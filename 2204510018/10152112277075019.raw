I myself am an activist and I used linux for anti-cor</p>\n<p>porate reasons. Later I realized that security was important and I do not want any holes in my system that would allow government spying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So much for Ubuntu 12.04 and later :(</p>\n<p>Now I realize that Stallman is a fanatic who is incapable of nuance. It is one thing to say the corporations are evil, but he says the end USERS are evil if they even use software that is not up to the FSF&#039;s standards. WTF? Seriously, WTFF?! The end users are not evil, they are the victims.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, isnt it hypocritical to say that you are not free if you cannot edit the code the way you like, and yet his hurd operating system does not let you install programs the way you like if they are not open source. Hurd will not even allow you to isntall software without the source code in readable format, while in Linux he merely disables any means of doing so and makes your system break if you try to use it along with this tools.....I guess that is &#039;clever&#039; of him :(</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stallman is a fanatic and he has it partially wrong. End users are not &quot;evil&quot; if they use some proprietary software. Maybe the corporations are, but an end user is not a bad horrible person if they choose to install non-free drivers in order to put an otherwise free OS on a laptop. Seriously, it is not a &quot;sin&quot;, and you should not feel guilty about it. The freedom to choose is more important than the freedom to edit the code for 99.9% of the population. If there are backdoors in the code, then they are the victims not the &#039;sinners&#039;.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stallman is also inconsistent towards intellectual property. He will not entirely reject it, only patents. He is credited with creating &quot;free software&quot;, but without his influence we would probably have a lot more software that was using a variant of Creative Commons, BSD-license, or simply Public Domain. Public Domain is the freest of the free EVEN IF somebody could in theory make something &#039;non-free&#039; while using its code.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The GPL has proven to be practical in many ways. It pulls software in without letting it out....I may concede that this has been good for building up Linux, but I feel it is an exageration to claim that free software was his invention. In fact, there was a whole hacker culture that came a little before he even got into college who already thought nothing of sharing software with each other, proprietary or not, and who were using the Public Domain to publish free software. GPL might have faded into irrelevancy if Linux had not chosen the GNU userland for his kernel and OS project....I am glad he did, but the respect needs to be shared. Today GNU tools are not essential to Linux, but they are nice and they help. GPL tools are vital to the OS however.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have come to believe that we should be more practical and forgiving in regard to free software. I do not believe it helps our cause if A) our OS fails to work on conventional hardware because of the strict fanatacism of developers, or B) If we insult and degrade people for their choice of software. Attack the company all you want, but do not make the end-user feel like they have violated holy ground. That kind of attitude drives people back to Windows and OSX. &#039;Good Riddance&#039; is not the right attitude if you are trying to erode sales of Windows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, being able to edit the code is something that matters to few people. Knowing the code is secure matters to more people, and people need to read the code to check to audit it.....This is why &#039;Open Source&#039; is good enough for me, even with incompatible liscense. Why? Because open-source at least means it can be audited, and if I really want to edit the code and delete their license, who exactly is going to stop me? Maybe I cannot sell it commercially without getting in trouble, but if I wanted to hack something the way Stallman hacked that zerox machine I do not see how an incompatible license is going to stop me. If I *can* access the code, that is just as good as if I *may* access it, for my purposes anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The the biggest way people get in trouble for violating proprietary agreements is when the FSF is the one who reports them!!! Again, WTFF?! Somebody claims to be about freedom, and then they turn around and report pirates and software crackers? :( If I use a clip from a proprietary music song that I downloaded for free, and I share it for free as a song that plays when you log in, is the FSF going to report me to the music industry? Fuck that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is why over the years I have slowly come to appreciate Linus more, though I do still respect some of Stallmans activism in other areas, and also feel that Linux is too buddy-buddy with corporations. However, Linus recently told off Nvidia and others, so he really does have a spine and I can appreciate that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From a post by <strong>Nick Djinn</strong></p>", "subject": "Free software religion", "id": "10152112277075019", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y7/r/8zhNI-VGpiI.png"}
