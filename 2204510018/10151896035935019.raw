These packages are generally installed with a package manager such as dpkg (althought apt-get is a front end).Ubuntu and Linux Mint are examples for the above.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other significant package is RPM (red hat package manager) which comes from the Red Hat Linux distribution but is used by plenty of other distributions. RPMs are often managed by a package manager such as YAST or apt-rpm.</p>\n<p>Fedora and OpenSUSE comes in this category</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would rather pick which features you want or don&#039;t want as part of the installed software, you may wish to build from source code. Source packages tend to be in tar.gz files or similar and often require you to unpack the file and run &quot;make&quot; with arguments depending on what you want built.Arch Linux uses &#039;pacman&#039;, a packet manager for binary paket management and the Arch Build Tool does the installation from the source file.Building from source isn&#039;t always the preferred way of installing software as it is generally a better idea to install something using the official package manager, but in something like linux from scratch or Gentoo (which uses portage to build from source), building from source code is the official way of installation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2- Update development model:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basically, Linux distros have two update models - Rolling release and Standard release.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>1.  Rolling release - Distros following such release models are updated continuously. It&#039;s not just the security patches and bug fixes, but even softwares you have installed from the official repositories. That is, there is no need to re-install the system when a new version of the distro is released because frankly, there is no new version. LOL!!</p>\n<p>You always have latest softwares, however, they are considered less stable and\u00a0slightly buggy since softwares may conflict. So, this is not an ideal choice for a server.</p>\n<p>Few distros following this cycle are Arch Linux, Gentoo, Linux Mint Debian Edition, openSUSE (Tumbelweed), etc.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.  Standard release - Distros following such release models have significant changes between different versions, requiring a complete operating system\u00a0reinstall, or at least a major\u00a0upgrade. The updates you receive are mostly security patches.</p>\n<p>The model has an advantage in stability. Standard releases are often viewed as more stable and\u00a0bug-free since software conflicts can be more easily addressed and the\u00a0software stack\u00a0more thoroughly tested and evaluated, during the\u00a0software development cycle.</p>\n<p>A distro belonging to this category is Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end - Server - Standard releases.</p>\n<p>Developer - Rolling releases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3- Base distros to watch :</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>rolling release means that you can update your entire system with no need to install a newer &quot;version&quot;, bleeding-edge mean that it uses the very latest applications and games ...</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Arch linux</strong> <strong>-</strong> A rolling release, bleeding-edge distro, very popular and minimal, uses vanilla packages with minimal patching. Arch linux uses pacman to install its packages which is well known and respected for its speed but is capable of compiling packages using the Arch Build System (ABS) so the user has a choice. Arch also makes use of AUR which allows individuals or groups of people to maintain software to be compiled such as  paid proprietary software demos, the hurd kernel, or other packages not found in the official arch linux repos. You build it as you wish from the beginning, the community is smaller but contribute a lot to both the AUR and the extensive wiki. Arch is known as user-centric so it doesn&#039;t aim to be user friendly but with it, you can truly learn linux , it has a 100% free software fork, 32 bits optimized i686 distro so it perform better than most 32 bits distro, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Debian -</strong> Second oldest distro, base of most others distros, various branches with various ranges of stability. It is capable of using the bsd kernel as well as many others. one of the biggest packages repository build from source with some patching without depending on another distro. not 100% free software endorsed distro but don&#039;t include non-free content in the distro base just by more repositories, support any architecture, release only when there is no bug left so expect the biggest linux stabilty of Debian stable. you could download the repositories on dvds easily, could be build as you wish and customised easily, widely loved on servers</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Fedora</strong> - is an RPM-based, general purpose collection of software, including an operating system based on the Linux kernel, developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.  Fedora\u2019s flexibility makes it capable of serving as a digital  repository for a variety of use cases. The Fedora Project&#039;s mission is  to lead the advancement of free and open source software and content as a  collaborative community.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ubuntu -</strong> most widely used distro, debian unstable based, the Linux Mint fork is on a hype, backed by a corporation, focus to be usable by beginners easily, may be critized for the touchscreen like interface of their main distro, release each 6 months with a long term support release each 2 years, massive community that don&#039;t contribute much, supported for 18 months for regular releases, 2-5 years for long term releases that apply only to the main distro, has a 100% free software distro fork, include a package manager where you could buy apps and games, always try to innovate so expect instability mostly on the main distro, the best hardware support out-of-the-box, biggest packages content</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gentoo -</strong> Source based/rolling release distro. Gentoo linux shares a great deal with Arch linux in that you start off with the bare minimum. Unlike Arch linux, Gentoo builds 99% of software from source code, which means if you want to install an application, you have to compile it first. The pro in this is you set USE flags to determine what is compiled and installed on your system which makes Gentoo totally optimized for your system and your hardware. Gentoo linux is capable on running on many different architectures, such as ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit, SPARC, mips, alpha, etc. Gentoo makes use of portage as its package manager which is very flexible and saves the user having to run multiple &quot;make&quot; jobs by hand. By default Gentoo makes use of the Gentoo patched linux kernel, but it can install many other kernels, such as the BSD kernel, xen kernel, vanilla etc.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Linux from scratch -</strong> just a manual to build every part of your setup, expect long compilation times, nearly perfectly optimisable for your hardware, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers, you build it as you want, very educative experience</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mandriva -</strong> Mandriva Linux is a distro backed by the french compagny mandriva. It is one of the greatest distros and is focused on begginers. Cause of financial problems in Mandriva, a dev team decided to fork it and name it Mageia. Mageia is now one of the most used distros.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SUSE -</strong> Novell backed corporate distro, you pay for it but it got free derivates, the OpenSUSE fork is said to be one of the best Kde desktop implementation. SUSE is used in servers compared to opensuse which is more for users.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Puppy Linux -</strong> older pcs distro compatible with some others distros, could be run from ram at a blazing speed. It is the base for a lot of distros like macpup. The installation iso is really lightweight. Puppy linux have his own package format.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>RedHat -</strong> most known corporate distro, 10 years of support, you pay for it but it got free derivates, the Fedora fork installer is one of the most featured. RedHat is known in the server industry for the popular RHEL.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Slackware -</strong> oldest distro, minimal, use vanilla packages, stable, manage dependencies manually, could be support for 13 years or almost. It is known for having really long devellopement cycles and to be extremly stable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Linux Mint</strong> - One of the  most popular and user friendly distros in the world, Linux Mint is notably fast and low on system resources. It has many repositories  but you can also add more in a similar way to Debian and Ubuntu. Linux Mint can be used by beginners and experts alike. New users may want to try out Linux Mint whereas Expert users may want to try LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) which is more complex and requires more care but it is rolling release and allows for more in depth learning of a Debian system. This distro is perfect for first time linux users.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As long as you stay near theses distros, you will have more support if needed, derivates are acceptable but it&#039;s far better if they are still compatible with the base distro to be usable even if it get discontinued, rolling releases distros are always updated and don&#039;t need releases, derivates from releases without rolling releases will need some patience before you could get new versions ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>4- Architecture :</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Old computers use mostly 32 bits, new pcs of 5 years or less could use 64 bits except some, mobile devices uses arm, old macs use ppc, this could influence you distro choice mostly if you use arm or ppc, Debian and Gentoo support any architecture ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some distro uses 32 bits content on 64 bits for some applications that may need them, mostly old apps not upgraded for 64 bits, try to don&#039;t use them if possible and use a 64 bits equivalent if possible because it may slow the system a bit but it&#039;s negligeable and almost nothing, but this count on an old pc as always.32 bits run slower on 64 bits than on 32 bits, however some distro added x32 support to circonvent that like Gentoo, also pretty negligeable ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note : </strong>If you choose 64 bit architecture then You need more RAM.. If you have less RAM choose 32 bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>5- Desktop choice :</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The interface that you distro will use, leading most of the standards, Freedesktop.org is to follow if you are not ready to be a little on your own ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop manager/environment    Full-featured</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>GNOME (GTK), MATE, KDE (Qt), Trinity, Cream</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gnome -</strong> second oldest desktop environment, could have seemed stable but they always reinvented the wheel in background now it&#039;s more seen, create some new freedesktop specifications.

Not too recommended for power using or normal user but still usefull for schools.</p>\n<p>\u00c9toil\u00e9 - \u00c9toil\u00e9 is a desktop environnement based on GNUstep. Have some similaritys to mac osx because they have the same base. \u00c9toil\u00e9 is still in work but its a lot difficult to install it on your system. A live cd of ubuntu with \u00c9toil\u00e9 exist, but the version of ubuntu and the version of \u00e9toil\u00e9 is obselete. A pretty interesting desktop environnement that i don&#039;t recommand to begginers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>FVWM-crystal -</strong> A desktop environnement based on FVWM that come with a elegant interface and cool desktop switching functionalities. Some apps seem to don&#039;t appear in the menus and required to be launched from the terminal from some reason. Not recommanded for end-users but guys who are multitasking a lot will find himself in fvwm-crystal</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mezzo -</strong> The default desktop environnement for Symphony, an old discontinued linux distribution. Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like &quot;The desktop is a folder&quot; and  nested menu systems and instead presents all needed information directly  to the user via the main desktop and four desk targets for tasks and  files related to System, Programs, Files, and Trash. This tries to  simplify the desktop. Inspired projects like the Kuartet desktop, based on kde.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ROX -</strong> The ROX Desktop is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System. It is based on the ROX-Filer which is a drag and drop spatial file manager. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License. The environment was inspired by the user interface of RISC OS. Programs can be installed or removed easily using Zero Install. As some interesting features. The desktop is still in devellopement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>UDE -</strong> In computing, UDE, the Unix Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment for the X Window System. Given its efficient and lightweight design it can be used on almost any Unix-like operating system, mostly without any porting effort. UDE&#039;s user interface philosophy is quite different from that of other desktop environments. It is designed to be used very efficiently after a short learning phase. There is no taskbar  or desktop panel or equivalent. Windows lack a title bar and as such  there are no buttons to close, resize, iconify or maximize windows on  the window borders. These buttons are replaced by the so-called hex menu  or honeycomb that appears when the user clicks on the window border.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pantheon -</strong> ElementaryOS desktop manager *new*</p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Shell *Most shells are based on Gnome 3*</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><em>Unity, Unity2D, GNOME Shell, Gnome classic, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma, Manokwari\u00a0- Manokwari</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gnome classic -</strong> Fallback mode for GNOME shell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>KDE Plasma -</strong> A shell develloped for kde 4.x</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GNOME Shell -</strong> Shell used on gnome3</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Unity/Unity2D -</strong> Shell developped for Ubuntu</p>\n<p>Recommended System Requirements for Unity</p>\n<p>Required RAM\t1 GB\t\u00a0Required CPU\t\u00a01 GHz</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Cinnamon -</strong> Shell build for Linux Mint.A fork of GNOME 3.</p>\n<p>Recommended System Requirements for Cinnamon</p>\n<p>Required RAM\t512 MB\t\u00a0Required CPU\t\u00a01 GHz</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Manokwari -</strong> Shell made for Blank On *Use html5/css3*</p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Windows manager Full-featured</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><em>Enlightenment, AfterStep, Compiz, KWin, Metacity, Mutter, Sawfish, Window Maker</em></p>\n<p><em>awesome, Blackbox, Fluxbox, FVWM, IceWM, JWM, Openbox, twm, WindowLab, Gala</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Enlightenment -</strong> Try to bring bells and whistles on very low specs hardware</p>\n<p>Recommended System Requirements for Enlightenment (E17)</p>\n<p>Required RAM\t64 MB\tRequired CPU\t\u00a0200 MHz</p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Openbox -</strong> could be used as backend for most desktop environnements to make them faster than their original window manager, try to follow freedesktop standards</p>\n<p>KWin - It&#039;s the default windows manager of KDE.

Xmonad comes with <em>nothing</em> but the window manager (not even a status bar) so these need to be implemented by the user(I suggest xmobar or dwm). Xmonad is extensible through reprogramming and recompiling a haskell file (so the compiler will tell you if there are problems in your configuration rather than it simply failing when you run it next). Xmonad can be built on top of other Desktop Environments such as KDE, GNOME, Xfce etc. by simply replacing their window managers. Users not comfortable with haskell programming may be inclined to take a look at <em>dwm</em> which is reprogrammable in C, <em>awesome</em> which mainly focuses on the fairly easy to grasp Lua scripting or <em>i3</em> which requires no programming at all. <strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>

uses like Framakey ubuntu-fr remix, if they help to install an harder distro easily like Bridge-Linux for Archlinux or Sabayon for Gentoo, if they come in with the bare minimal like k/l/ubuntu slim remix that come just with a minimal graphical interface with apps just enough to build your desktop on it as you wish easily and in some cases if it install the desktop or window manager of choice, other than that, you lose your time and another distro may do the same for you easily by messing a little ...</p>\n<p><strong><strong>
