These packages are generally installed with a package manager such as dpkg (althought apt-get is a front end).Ubuntu and Linux Mint are examples for the above.</p><p><br /></p><p>The other significant package is RPM (red hat package manager) which comes from the Red Hat Linux distribution but is used by plenty of other distributions. RPMs are often managed by a package manager such as zypper or apt-rpm.</p><p>Fedora and openSUSE comes in this category</p><p><br /></p><p>If you would rather pick which features you want or don&#039;t want as part of the installed software, you may wish to build from source code. Source packages tend to be in tar.gz files or similar and often require you to unpack the file and run &quot;make&quot; with arguments depending on what you want built.Arch Linux uses &#039;pacman&#039;, a packet manager for binary paket management and the Arch Build Tool does the installation from the source file.Building from source isn&#039;t always the preferred way of installing software as it is generally a better idea to install something using the official package manager, but in something like linux from scratch or Gentoo (which uses portage to build from source), building from source code is the official way of installation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>2- Update development model:</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Basically, Linux distros have two update models - Rolling release and Standard release.</p><p><br /></p><p>1.  Rolling release - Distros following such release models are updated continuously. It&#039;s not just the security patches and bug fixes, but even softwares you have installed from the official repositories. That is, there is no need to re-install the system when a new version of the distro is released because frankly, there is no new version. LOL!!</p><p>You always have latest softwares, however, they are considered less stable and\u00a0slightly buggy since softwares may conflict. So, this is not an ideal choice for a server.</p><p><br /></p><p>Rolling and semi rolling releases :</p><p><br /></p><p>Arch Linux, Gentoo, Linux Mint Debian Edition, openSUSE (Tumbelweed), Debian Sid, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>2.  Standard release - Distros following such release models have significant changes between different versions, requiring a complete operating system\u00a0reinstall, or at least a major\u00a0upgrade. The updates you receive are mostly security patches.</p><p><br /></p><p>The model has an advantage in stability that help for servers and appliance like uses like game console or television. Standard releases are often viewed as more stable since software conflicts can be more easily addressed and the\u00a0software stack\u00a0more thoroughly tested and evaluated, during the\u00a0software development cycle.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>3- Base distros to watch :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><em>rolling release means that you can update your entire system with no need to install a newer &quot;version&quot;, bleeding-edge mean that it uses the very latest applications and games ...</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Arch linux</strong> <strong>-</strong> A rolling release, bleeding-edge distro, very popular and minimal, uses vanilla packages with minimal patching. Arch linux uses pacman to install its packages which is well known and respected for its speed but is capable of compiling packages using the Arch Build System (ABS) so the user has a choice. Arch also makes use of AUR which allows individuals or groups of people to maintain software to be compiled such as  paid proprietary software demos, the hurd kernel, or other packages not found in the official arch linux repos. You build it as you wish from the beginning, the community is smaller but contribute a lot to both the AUR and the extensive wiki. Arch is known as user-centric so it doesn&#039;t aim to be user friendly but with it, you can truly learn linux , it has a 100% free software fork, 32 bits optimized i686 distro so it perform better than most 32 bits distro, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers. Official repositories content may lack, Aur community repository maintainers may not be active so outdated packages happen and using Aur may mean compiling so taking a lot of time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Debian -</strong> Second oldest distro, base of most others distros, able to use various branches with various ranges of stability at once with apt-pinning. It is capable of using the bsd kernel as well as many others. one of the biggest packages repository build from source with some patching without depending on another distro. not 100% free software endorsed distro but don&#039;t include non-free content in the distro base just by more repositories, support any architecture, release only when there is no bug left so expect the biggest linux stabilty of Debian stable. you could download the repositories on dvds easily, could be build as you wish and customised easily, widely loved on servers</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Fedora</strong> - is an RPM-based, general purpose collection of software, including an operating system based on the Linux kernel, developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.  Fedora\u2019s flexibility makes it capable of serving as a digital  repository for a variety of use cases. The Fedora Project&#039;s mission is  to lead the advancement of free and open source software and content as a  collaborative community.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Ubuntu -</strong> most widely used distro, debian unstable based, the Linux Mint fork is on a hype, backed by a corporation, focus to be usable by beginners easily, may be critized for the touchscreen like interface of their main distro, release each 6 months with a long term support release each 2 years, massive community that don&#039;t contribute much, supported for 18 months for regular releases, 2-5 years for long term releases that apply only to the main distro, has a 100% free software distro fork, include a package manager where you could buy apps and games, always try to innovate so expect instability mostly on the main distro, the best hardware support out-of-the-box, biggest packages content</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Gentoo -</strong> Source based/rolling release distro. Gentoo linux shares a great deal with Arch linux in that you start off with the bare minimum. Unlike Arch linux, Gentoo builds 99% of software from source code, which means if you want to install an application, you have to compile it first. The pro in this is you set USE flags to determine what is compiled and installed on your system which makes Gentoo totally optimized for your system and your hardware. Gentoo linux is capable on running on many different architectures, such as ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit, SPARC, mips, alpha, etc. Gentoo makes use of portage as its package manager which is very flexible and saves the user having to run multiple &quot;make&quot; jobs by hand and that also break the myth that Gentoo don&#039;t have packages. By default Gentoo makes use of the Gentoo patched linux kernel, but it can install many other kernels, such as the BSD kernel, xen kernel, vanilla, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Linux from scratch -</strong> just a manual to build every part of your setup, expect long compilation times, nearly perfectly optimisable for your hardware, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers, you build it as you want, very educative experience</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Mandriva -</strong> Mandriva Linux is a distro backed by the french compagny mandriva. It is one of the greatest distros and is focused on begginers. Cause of financial problems in Mandriva, a dev team decided to fork it and name it Mageia. Mageia is now one of the most used distros.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>SUSE -</strong> previously a Novell backed corporate distro. SUSE partnered up with Microsoft in 2006 but holds no affiliation with them besides an interoperability strategy. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop are both free to use but require a paid subscription for patch and updates. The openSUSE fork is said to be one of the best KDE desktop implementation, but also supports all other Desktop Environments to the fullest. SUSE distros use YaST as a control center for administration. SUSE distros also support multiple virtualization options such as KVM, XEN, and LXC out of the box. SUSE is the first Enterprise distribution to call BTRFS &quot;ready for production&quot; with it being the default filesystem for upcoming releases.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Puppy Linux -</strong> older pcs distro compatible with some others distros, could be run from ram at a blazing speed. It is the base for a lot of distros like macpup. The installation iso is really lightweight. Puppy linux have his own package format.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>RedHat -</strong> most known corporate distro, 10 years of support, you pay for it but it got free derivates, the Fedora fork installer is one of the most featured. RedHat is known in the server industry for the popular RHEL.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Slackware -</strong> oldest distro, minimal, use vanilla packages, stable, manage dependencies manually, could be support for 13 years or almost. It is known for having really long development cycles and to be extremely stable.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Linux Mint</strong> - One of the  most popular and user friendly distros in the world, Linux Mint is notably fast and low on system resources. It has many repositories  but you can also add more in a similar way to Debian and Ubuntu. Linux Mint can be used by beginners and experts alike. New users may want to try out Linux Mint whereas Expert users may want to try LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) which is more complex and requires more care but it is rolling release and allows for more in depth learning of a Debian system. This distro is perfect for first time linux users.</p><p><br /></p><p>As long as you stay near theses distros, you will have more support if needed, derivates are acceptable but it&#039;s far better if they are still compatible with the base distro to be usable even if it get discontinued, rolling releases distros are always updated and don&#039;t need releases, derivates from releases without rolling releases will need some patience before you could get new versions ...</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>4- Architecture :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Old computers use mostly 32 bits, new pcs of 5 years or less could use 64 bits except some, mobile devices uses arm, old macs use ppc, this could influence you distro choice mostly if you use arm or ppc, Debian and Gentoo support any architecture ...</p><p><br /></p><p>Some distro uses 32 bits content on 64 bits for some applications that may need them, mostly old apps not upgraded for 64 bits, try to don&#039;t use them if possible and use a 64 bits equivalent if possible because it may slow the system a bit but it&#039;s negligeable and almost nothing, but this count on an old pc as always.32 bits run slower on 64 bits than on 32 bits, however some distro added x32 support to circonvent that like Gentoo, also pretty negligible ...</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note : </strong>If you choose 64 bit architecture then You need more RAM.. If you have less RAM choose 32 bit.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>5- Desktop choice :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The interface that you distro will use, leading most of the standards, <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FFreedesktop.org%2F&amp;h=qAQFXm5_7&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/Freedesktop.org\\/&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/l.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252FFreedesktop.org\\u00252F&amp;h=qAQFXm5_7&amp;s=1&quot;);\">Freedesktop.org</a> is to follow if you are not ready to be a little on your own ...</p><p><br /></p><p>A desktop manager is a full package with a window manager and various apps to make the experience better but come with a price since you get less independence if changes occur that you don&#039;t want so a window manager could be a good choice even if you have to mess a bit.</p><p><br /></p><p>Benchmarks of ram usage of various WM/DE :</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"#\" role=\"button\"><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fl3net.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F07%2Fcmp-all3.png&amp;h=9AQHXQ0Gu&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/l3net.files.wordpress.com\\/2013\\/07\\/cmp-all3.png&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/l.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fl3net.files.wordpress.com\\u00252F2013\\u00252F07\\u00252Fcmp-all3.png&amp;h=9AQHXQ0Gu&amp;s=1&quot;);\">http://l3net.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cmp-all3.png</a></a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilesorr.com%2Fwm%2Fmemory32.html&amp;h=sAQEZQusL&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.gilesorr.com\\/wm\\/memory32.html&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/l.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.gilesorr.com\\u00252Fwm\\u00252Fmemory32.html&amp;h=sAQEZQusL&amp;s=1&quot;);\">http://www.gilesorr.com/wm/memory32.html</a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilesorr.com%2Fwm%2Fmemory64.html&amp;h=PAQHYV_Eo&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.gilesorr.com\\/wm\\/memory64.html&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/l.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.gilesorr.com\\u00252Fwm\\u00252Fmemory64.html&amp;h=PAQHYV_Eo&amp;s=1&quot;);\">http://www.gilesorr.com/wm/memory64.html</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Desktop manager/environment    Full-featured</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><em>GNOME (GTK), MATE, KDE (Qt), Trinity, Cream</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Gnome -</strong> second oldest desktop environment, could have seemed stable but they always reinvented the wheel in background now it&#039;s more seen, create some new freedesktop specifications.

Have some similaritys to mac osx because they have the same base. \u00c9toil\u00e9 is still in work but its a lot difficult to install it on your system. A live cd of ubuntu with \u00c9toil\u00e9 exist, but the version of ubuntu and the version of \u00e9toil\u00e9 is obselete. A pretty interesting desktop environment that i don&#039;t recommend to beginners.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>FVWM-crystal -</strong> A desktop environment based on FVWM that come with a elegant interface and cool desktop switching functionalists.

Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like &quot;The desktop is a folder&quot; and  nested menu systems and instead presents all needed information directly  to the user via the main desktop and four desk targets for tasks and  files related to System, Programs, Files, and Trash. This tries to  simplify the desktop. Inspired projects like the Kuartet desktop, based on kde.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ROX -</strong> The ROX Desktop is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System. It is based on the ROX-Filer which is a drag and drop spatial file manager. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License. The environment was inspired by the user interface of RISC OS. Programs can be installed or removed easily using Zero Install. As some interesting features. The desktop is still in development.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>UDE -</strong> In computing, UDE, the Unix Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment for the X Window System. Given its efficient and lightweight design it can be used on almost any Unix-like operating system, mostly without any porting effort. UDE&#039;s user interface philosophy is quite different from that of other desktop environments. It is designed to be used very efficiently after a short learning phase. There is no taskbar  or desktop panel or equivalent. Windows lack a title bar and as such  there are no buttons to close, resize, iconify or maximize windows on  the window borders. These buttons are replaced by the so-called hex menu  or honeycomb that appears when the user clicks on the window border.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Pantheon -</strong> ElementaryOS desktop manager *new*</p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Shell *Most shells are based on Gnome 3*</strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><em>Unity, Unity2D, GNOME Shell, Gnome classic, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma, Manokwari\u00a0- Manokwari</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Gnome classic -</strong> Fallback mode for GNOME shell.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>KDE Plasma -</strong> A shell developed for kde 4.x</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>GNOME Shell -</strong> Shell used on gnome3</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Unity/Unity2D -</strong> Shell developed for Ubuntu</p><p>Recommended System Requirements for Unity</p><p>Required RAM\t1 GB\t\u00a0Required CPU\t\u00a01 GHz</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Cinnamon -</strong> Shell build for Linux Mint.A fork of GNOME 3.</p><p>Recommended System Requirements for Cinnamon</p><p>Required RAM\t512 MB\t\u00a0Required CPU\t\u00a01 GHz</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Manokwari -</strong> Shell made for Blank On *Use html5/css3*</p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Windows manager Full-featured</strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><em>Enlightenment, AfterStep, Compiz, KWin, Metacity, Mutter, Sawfish, Window Maker</em></p><p><em>awesome, Blackbox, Fluxbox, FVWM, IceWM, JWM, Openbox, twm, WindowLab, Gala</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Enlightenment -</strong> Try to bring bells and whistles on very low specs hardware</p><p>Recommended System Requirements for Enlightenment (E17)</p><p>Required RAM\t64 MB\tRequired CPU\t\u00a0200 MHz</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong>Openbox -</strong> could be used as backend for most desktop environments to make them faster than their original window manager, try to follow freedesktop standards</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Fluxbox -</strong> cousin of Openbox and Blackbox, include slit as panel, lighter than Openbox.</p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>KWin -</strong> It&#039;s the default windows manager of KDE.

Xmonad comes with <em>nothing</em> but the window manager (not even a status bar) so these need to be implemented by the user(I suggest xmobar or dwm). Xmonad is extensible through reprogramming and recompiling a haskell file (so the compiler will tell you if there are problems in your configuration rather than it simply failing when you run it next). Xmonad can be built on top of other Desktop Environments such as KDE, GNOME, Xfce etc. by simply replacing their window managers. Users not comfortable with haskell programming may be inclined to take a look at <em>dwm</em> which is reprogrammable in C, <em>awesome</em> which mainly focuses on the fairly easy to grasp Lua

worth a look in some case, mostly for special uses like Framakey ubuntu-fr remix, if they help to install an harder distro easily like Bridge-Linux for Archlinux or Sabayon for Gentoo, if they come in with the bare minimal like k/l/ubuntu slim remix that come just with a minimal graphical interface with apps just enough to build your desktop on it as you wish easily and in some cases if it install the desktop or window manager of choice, other than that, you lose your time and another distro may do the same for you easily by messing a little ...</p><p><strong><strong>

/></p><p><strong>10- Graphics drivers</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Recommanded graphics chips :</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel HD 4000+ : barely no config, decent performance even for light gaming, fully open source, best when you don&#039;t need a graphic card since they&#039;re integrated with some Intel cpus now but you need a suitable motherboard, official intel drivers installer don&#039;t follow distros developpement so it could be an issue on a LTS distro when you want the top performance, otherwise you lose in stability.</p><p><br /></p><p>Amd HD 5000 to HD7000 : since Amd chips aren&#039;t top performers on Linux, they&#039;re however the most performing open source drivers\u00a0</p><p><br /></p><p>Nvdia GTX 650+ : Nvidia are top performers for proprietary drivers, best for gaming, GTX 650+ should support Steam/SteamOS Miracast and Nvidia Grid for game streaming from a Windows pc a really great feature to watch, it&#039;s usable now by Stream my game and Splashtop, have a lot at Onlive if you wanna try a demo of that, Nvidia have the widest/longest proprietary support so you should be well on them, their open source drivers should improve slowly with the release of more documentation since Valve got Steam on Linux, best for rolling-release since they follow Xorg/Kernel developpement.</p><p>General hardware choice :</p><p>Intel+Nvidia = best proprietary drivers by a long shot, poor or open sour ce drivers need an older card</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel+AMD = Poor proprietary drivers, open source drive could almost beat it, best open source drivers for performance</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel+Intel GPU = great support but not so good for gaming</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel+SIS/VIA/Other GPU = avoid</p><p><br /></p><p>AMD+Nvidia = best proprietary drivers by a long shot, poor or open sour ce drivers need an older card</p><p><br /></p><p>AMD+AMD =  Poor proprietary drivers, open source drive could almost beat it, best open source drivers for performance</p><p><br /></p><p>AMD+Intel GPU = impossible</p><p><br /></p><p>AMD+SIS/VIA/Other GPU = avoid</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel start to add some proprietary components. (according to Stallman)Amd hardware decoding is proprietary so it&#039;s a bit akward to use it over intel graphics that have an open source hardware decoding. (will use the cpu instead ...)Nvidia hardware decoding is open source but akward since the drivers is proprietary apart some cards supporting the poor nouveau drivers.</p><p><br /></p><p>Graphics drivers for Ati/Amd :</p><p><br /></p><p>HD8000 - Catalyst and kernel 3.4+, there&#039;s some rebrands that could use open source drivers</p><p>*09/01/14 the latest beta drivers worth moving to ...*</p><p><br /></p><p>HD5000-HD7000 - Catalyst or kernel 2.6.38+ with xf86-video-ati/radeon 6.14.0 and mesa 7.11</p><p>*Note : HD6000 have 80% of Catalyst performance with really good open source drivers, try the kernel 3.13 with open source drivers*</p><p><br /></p><p>HD2000-HD4000 - Catalyst Legacy 13.1 with kernel 3.4- and Xserver 1.12- so you could lock packages on some distros for that, open source drivers are decent if you don&#039;t wanna mess too much.</p><p><br /></p><p>Others - use the open source drivers, catalysyt 9.3 is sometimes usable but not worth the time spend, better upgrade than mess with theses.</p><p><br /></p><p>*Note : Catalyst has a powerstate feature to save energy, also /etc/X11/xorg.conf need Option &quot;UseFastTLS&quot; &quot;2&quot; to fix an issue for some old games, libxvba/xbva is needed for hardware acceleration, also remember that Amd/Ati drop proprietary drivers over time so it could be annoying, also now the kernel 3.13 would do better for open source Amd drivers.*</p><p><br /></p><p>Nvidia graphics drivers :</p><p><br /></p><p>Most Nvidia cards - Nvidia 331 branch drivers</p><p><br /></p><p>Geforce 6000-7000 - Nvidia 304 branch drivers with xorg-server 1.15-</p><p><br /></p><p>Geforce Fx 5000 - Nvidia 173 branch drivers with xorg-server 1.15-</p><p><br /></p><p>Geforce 2/3/4 - Nvidia 96 branch drivers with xorg-server 1.12-</p><p><br /></p><p>Vanta/Riva/TNT/Geforce 256 - Nvidia 71 branch drivers *maybe better upgrade*</p><p><br /></p><p>Note : libvdpau or libvdpau_trace need to be added separately for hardware acceleration, open source nvidia drivers aren&#039;t much reliables at the moment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Intel open source graphics drivers requirements :</p><p><br /></p><p>Linux Kernel, Mesa, xf86-video-intel, Libva, vaapi intel-driver, Cairo, Xserver Xorg, Intel-gpu-tools</p><p>*since it&#039;s open source, the more up-to-date the better but try to stick to the latest LTS kernel according

desktop environnements may replace their window manager for Openbox or another, most of the time you just need a panel for more comfort, there&#039;s near twenty to choose from many come with a desktop environnement but could be used separately, after that you choose apps, Xfce apps are well done for most uses for a light desktop, Lxde ones are maded to be independants to pull less dependencies, Kde apps are great since they work well together a little like Mac os X apps, ...</p><p><br /></p><p>Also with time a killer feature could make you move to a selected component but you

depth, then move to Debian testing, just remember that network-manager need managed=true setting if used and you may need to activate the contrib and non-free repositories, there&#039;s some isos with the non-free components to save some time, check there :<a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Flive.debian.net%2Fcdimage%2Frelease%2Fstable%2Bnonfree%2F&amp;h=AAQEwC4m9&amp;s=1\"

would suggest to jump from Xfce to Openbox so Crunchbang could be an alternative to start faster on Debian.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>21 - Highest Pro/Con of a few distros :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>OpenSuse = Pro - One if not the best Kde integration/Con - may be more difficult to use for new users</p><p>Archlinux = Pro - Best wiki/Con - Poor attitude for beginners Ubuntu = Pro - usually the best hardware support/Con - Lock users in slowly by lack of knowledge</p><p>Debian = Pro- Impressive Stablility/Con- Manual hardware configuration needed</p><p>CentOS = Pro - RHEL clone/Con - Unfriendly for a desktop</p><p>Gentoo = Pro - Flexibility/Con - compiling time</p><p>Mint = Pro - codecs included in the live session/Con - security at risk since the kernel isn&#039;t much updated</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>22- The social cost of ignorance :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>RTFM aka Read the fucking manual is partly an insult and a truth, ignorance may bring the cost of some things to 25% more, for example a router for a color booklet and the pictures in it, for the cd with an easy installer, for the quick configuration buttons, for a virtual online interface, phone support and for the store professionnal install when a single sheet with the 192.168.0.1 method would be enough.</p><p><br /></p><p>Knowledge is a great way to do awesome savings, to avoid to be locked in, so remember that having minimal knowledge benefit a lot, you don&#039;t need to go far and new skills could be valuable since they may help to learn others skills, like learning to read helped you to learn a lot at school after.So try to learn the more simple and versatile way first if possible but cheat with an easy method if needed, you know the alternatives to don&#039;t finish in a dead end.</p><p><br /></p><p>Remember that it apply to almost anything so your phone/cable/internet/cellphone bill get higher because of that since the 300 000$ cost for phone support of 100 000 unneeded phone calls get straight in the price of your service.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>23 - Wine performance :</strong><br /></p><p>Nvidia cards will run at 60% of their full speed under Wine with

that the ranking is highly relative since experienced users barely use it, so releases make some upvoting for most distros and since the userbase is mostly beginners and midrange users don&#039;t take it as true, however the package management cheatsheet and the distro search tool is nice, not all distros are ranked since it may take 7 years to be in it and it could take a lot of time before being in so a lot of distros exist without being in it that are still interesting sometimes.</p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>Note 1 :</strong> You could also use apps from Windows with various solutions, your mileage may vary, you may also try portable apps that I suggest you to use for occassionnal Windows uses when traveling ...</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note 2 :</strong> There&#039;s some tools to make an app from website *webapp*, so you could include you prefered online app easily, they open on a browser but you don&#039;t have to put the link or remember the link, you need a web browser able to make web apps *Chrome/Chromium/Iron/Epiphany/Midori*, just take care because they aren&#039;t usable offline but it may make a desktop far lighter without losing the ease of use, just watch your internet connection bandwith, theses web apps are just web pages so they are usable on any operating system ...</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note 3 :</strong> Some apps could be prefered because that they are usable on most operating system, so you will fell at home almost anywhere, they&#039;re named cross-platform applications ...<strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>Reminder :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Mostly writen by an admin using Debian, so it could have a little biais however since Debian influence on Linux itself, it&#039;s hard to not be biaised for it, content is relative but done neutral, suggestions, comparisons and others are done to jumpstart beginners but you could easily go another way, mostly inspired by beginners questions so I must credit the whole community as they helped in it somehow ...</p><br /><br />", "revision": "10155616957570019", "id":
