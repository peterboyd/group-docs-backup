Type &quot;man subject&quot; first on the  command line. Q to quit. Replace subject with what you&#039;re interested in  suchas &quot;man apache&quot; or &quot;man cron&quot;. --help also produces the expected set  of results.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>BASH programming intro:\u00a0http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html</p>\n<p>BASH is the general purpose Linux shell which has become the standard  of the community. If you&#039;re coming from ksh or ash, it will feel  similar. You can make your life a lot easier if you learn how to script  one offs on the command line.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>PERL programming intro:\u00a0http://perldoc.perl.org/perlintro.html</p>\n<p>PERL became the crossover language for a lot of people (including  myself) where we had to write-once-run-everywhere among disparate Linux  systems. Perl is available on almost all *NIX similar boxes. If it&#039;s not  written in BASH, it&#039;s probably written in PERL. (If you&#039;re wondering  &quot;Can I script for a Mac? Look for perl).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Look.org:\u00a0http://kde-look.org/ and\u00a0http://gnome-look.org/</p>\n<p>Think someone&#039;s theme is cool?

Both vi and emacs are installed in major *NIX systems. Pick one, learn  it and love it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What&#039;s the code look like OR where did all this come from:\u00a0http://www.gentoo.org/</p>\n<p>The last living source distro with any serious community (slackware -  you break my heart). Want to tune the distro to 11? Read up. Think  building a kernel is kool? You can probably learn here. Glutton for  punishment or simply want to have compiler races? Great!
