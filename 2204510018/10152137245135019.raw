One desktop environnement, multiples UI&#039;s</p>\n<p>One of the major problems with the linux desktop is still the division of the market, and the desktops environnements are to blame. An application that is wrote for gnome will look ugly in kde, and an application made for kde will look ugly on gnome. It&#039;s a pain to devellopers to support the 10 thousands of desktops environnements available. We should create a tiny tiny desktop environnement, where we can create Ui&#039;s over it. So we would unify the desktops environnements.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Too much base distros</p>\n<p>If you want to get all the 1% of the linux market, you need to publish to all distros, like gentoo,slackware,arch,debian,opensuse,redhat,mageia,mandriva,puppy linux,ubuntu, fedora and the list goes on. It&#039;s a pain too developers to support that many distros. Theres advantages in all of them, but this divison is painfull to devs, and discourage them to develop on the rich linux market.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Sound system is crappy</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The most painfull thing in the linux desktop is still the sound. Pulseaudio is buggyand alsa crash often. Theres too much levels of sound, so it can be long to know where is the problem. We need to integrate the sound system in ther kernel, no more pain for anyone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. People want Linux to be cool</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they hear about Linux, they say it&#039;s for geeks. Why? cause the first thing you find when you search linux is a command line. We need to make Linux cool to the people. Giving a reputation to Linux. Cause theres ubuntu, yeah, but they want Linux, not ubuntu puppy or 100000000000 other distros. It&#039;s fine to have distros, but a main Linux distro would be better for everyone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. More Advertising</p>\n<p>Why do people buy samsung,apple and microsoft junk?</p>\n<p>Cause they see it to the TV. If the people see Linux to the TV, with a cool aspect, they will make research and probably download it. But now, the only ones who advertise it are the linux fans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>6.Linux in shops</p>\n<p>Linux need to be sell in the shops, just like microsoft windows. If people see that theres an alternative for Windows in the shop, and only cost like 20 bucks, they will want to buy it. Cause people doesn&#039;t trust internet, they would think they downloading a malware. In shop, it&#039;s safe and secure. We need to have simple instructions manual for installing it( botting from the cd)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>7. Linux preinstalled</p>\n<p>People will use what come with their pc. They don&#039;t want to change of operating system, or just doesn&#039;t care. And like i said before, they don&#039;t trust internet, and most of the linux PC&#039;s are sell on the internet. We need to sell linux PC&#039;s and tablets in store, and making advertise for it in stores so people see it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>8. 2 years rolling realese</p>\n<p>People don&#039;t want to change, and surely not every 6 months. We need to rolling a release every 2 years, but making it very stable and making big security update. Innovate a lot every release will be better than a little bit every 1/2 years. This is the consumer side, cause i know theres a lot of people who love having a lot of releases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>9. Selling linux like a high-quality product</p>\n<p>Why do people love mac?, cause you look cool with friends, the OS is cool and is connected to a lot of services. We need to give Linux a fresh name, who sound pure,fresh and mature. Linux sound geeky. Ubuntu is a good name thought. If we make it look like a cool product, it will be one. But it&#039;s all about simplicity.</p>\n<p>Windows and apple logo are pretty simple and catchy. Linux as a pingouin. If we success to build a new personality to linux, maybe it will catch with consumers. The hardware design is pretty important. It have to match with the operating system color. classy colors are:transparent, white, steel and grey-black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>10. Unique look</p>\n<p>Giving a unique look to Linux, something who is totaly different from Windows and Mac. We don&#039;t have to copy cause we think newcomers will feel more comfortable. NO! We need to make them feel like they are touching something totally new.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu unity and gnome 3 are great exemples, they are making Linux look cool. KDE look too much geeky and the others look like.... windows XP.</p>", "subject": "How to fix Linux", "id": "10152137245135019", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yi/r/-64q65AWgXb.png"}
