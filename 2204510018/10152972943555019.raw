You are probably not interested in this<br />if you only know DOS - it helps /a lot/ if you have managed unix even a<br />little: used minix or similar.\u00a0 Reading C-source and understanding what<br />happens is another nice ability.\u00a0 Being beta also means it has many<br />potential bugs, so watch out (although 0.11 seems to have been<br />relatively stable).<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This information sheet has been compiled by Robert Blum<br />(blum&#064;cip-s01.informatik.rwth-aachen.de), but he has problems posting<br />it.\u00a0 Questions/suggestions about the SHEET should go to him, about Linux<br />either to me or to the mailing-list.<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Linus (torvalds&#064;kruuna.helsinki.fi)<br /><br />PS.

WHAT IS LINUX 0.11<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LINUX 0.11 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.\u00a0 It implements a<br />subset of System V and POSIX functionality.\u00a0 LINUX has been written<br />from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&amp;T or MINIX<br />code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.<br />For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code<br />via anonymous FTP.\u00a0 LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting<br />to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel<br />makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Version 0.11 is still a beta release, but it already provides much<br />of the functionality of a System V.3 kernel.\u00a0 For example, various<br />users have been able to port programs such as bison/flex without having<br />to modify code at all.\u00a0 Another indication of its maturity is that<br />it is now possible to do LINUX kernel development using LINUX itself <br />and freely-available programming tools.<br /><br />2. LINUX features<br />\u00a0 - System call compatible with a subset of System V and POSIX<br />\u00a0 - Full multiprogramming (multiple programs can run at once)<br />\u00a0 - Memory paging with copy-on-write<br />\u00a0 - Demand loading of executables<br />\u00a0 - Page sharing of executables<br />\u00a0 - ANSI compliant C compiler (gcc)<br />\u00a0 - A complete set of compiler writing tools<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (bison as yacc-replacement, flex as lex replacement)<br />\u00a0 - The GNU &#039;Bourne again&#039; shell (bash)<br />\u00a0 - Micro emacs<br />\u00a0 - most utilities you need for development<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (cat, cp, kermit, ls, make, etc.)<br />\u00a0 - Over 200 library procedures (atoi, fork, malloc, read, stdio, etc.)<br />\u00a0 - Currently 4 national keyboards: Finnish/US/German/French<br />\u00a0 - Full source code (in C) for the OS is freely distributable<br />\u00a0 - Full source code of the tools can be gotten from many anonymous ftp sites<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Almost the entire suite of GNU programs has been ported to Linux.)<br />\u00a0 - Runs in protected mode on 386 and above<br />\u00a0 - Support for extended memory up to 16M on 386 and above<br />\u00a0 - RS-232 serial line support with terminal emulation, kermit, zmodem, etc.<br />\u00a0 - Supports the real time clock<br /><br /><br />3. HARDWARE REQUIRED<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - A 386 or 486 machine with an AT-bus.\u00a0 (EISA will probably work, also,<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but you will need an AT-bus hard disk controller.)<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both DX and SX processors will work.<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - A hard disk implementing the standard AT hard disk interface--<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for example, an IDE drive.\u00a0 SCSI drives are not supported yet.<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - A high-density disk drive--either 5.25&quot; (1.2MB) or 3.5&quot; (1.44MB).<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - At least 2 megabytes of RAM.\u00a0 (LINUX will boot in 2 Mb.\u00a0 To use<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gcc at least 4 MB are required.)<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - Any video card of the following: Hercules,CGA,EGA,VGA<br /><br />In addition, LINUX supports<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - Up to two serial lines<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - A real time clock <br /><br />4. PARTIAL LIST OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE FOR LINUX 0.11 <br />\u00a0\u00a0 - The MTOOLS package (reading/writing to DOS filesystems)<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - The complete GNU filetools (ls, cat, cp, mv, ...)<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - The GNU C compiler with GNU assembler, linker, ar, ...<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - bison<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - flex<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - rcs<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - pmake (BSD 4.3 Reno/BSD 4.4\u00a0 make)<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - kermit<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - Micro emacs<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - less<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - mkfs<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - fsck<br />\u00a0\u00a0 - mount/umount<br /><br /><br />5. LINUX BINARIES<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The LINUX binaries and sources are available at three<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 anonymous FTP sites. These are:<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux\">tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux</a><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/msdos/replace<br /><br /><br />6. LEGAL STATUS OF LINUX<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although LINUX is\u00a0 supplied with the\u00a0 complete source\u00a0 code, it is<br />copyrighted software.\u00a0 Unlike MINIX, however, it is available for free,<br />provided\u00a0 you obey\u00a0 to the\u00a0 rules specified\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 LINUX\u00a0 copyright.<br /><br /><br />7. NEWS ABOUT LINUX<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since LINUX&#039;s\u00a0 introduction to the public there has been a rapidly<br />growing mailing list, &quot;linux-activists&#064;niksula.hut.fi&quot;. To subscribe to <br />this\u00a0 list,\u00a0 mail to &quot;linux-activists-requests&#064;niksula.hut.fi&quot;.\u00a0 If the<br />traffic in this lists increases\u00a0 further, there are\u00a0 plans to swap ( at <br />least partially ) over\u00a0 to comp.os.misc, so\u00a0 watch out\u00a0 for\u00a0 any\u00a0 LINUX <br />articles in\u00a0 this group.\u00a0 For the current status of LINUX, do &quot;finger<br />torvalds&#064;kruuna.helsinki.fi&quot;.<br /><br /><br />8. FUTURE PLANS<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work is underway on LINUX version 1.0, which will close some of the<br />gaps in the present implementation.\u00a0 Various people are currently working<br />on:<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Math support/fp emulation in the kernel<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Page swapping (since paging is already implemented)<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - A virtual filesystem layer <br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - STREAMS <br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - POSIX job control (This is already alpha and will probably be <br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 out with Version 0.12.)<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - init/getty/login<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - symbolic links<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Interprocess communication<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - IEEE POSIX P1003.1 / P1003.2 compatibility<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - SCSI support<br />If you want to help, join the mailing list.<br /><br /><br /></p>", "revision": "10152972943540019", "id": "10152972943555019", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y7/r/8zhNI-VGpiI.png"}
