            <p>* <strong>To-do list</strong> * [add yours ...]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Corrections</p>
<p>- Compare desktop managers and windows managers *50% done*</p>
<p>- Describe distro bases *80% done*</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1- The distro base type is important :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Packages <em>(Deb, rpm, and others</em>) or sources ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to update easily and fast, packages are for you, most distros use Debian software packages (Deb) derived from Debian. The other significant package is RPM (red hat package manager) which comes from the Red Hat Linux Distribution but is used by plenty of other distributions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don&#039;t care much about time to update and want pure performance over ease of use, building from source may suit you best.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2- Base distros to watch :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>rolling release means that you can update your entire system with no need to install a newer &quot;version&quot;, bleeding-edge mean that it uses the very latest applications and games ...</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Arch linux -</strong> A rolling release, bleeding-edge distro, very popular and minimal, uses vanilla packages with minimal patching. Arch linux uses pacman to install its packages which is well known and respected for its speed but is capable of compiling packages using the Arch Build System (ABS) so the user has a choice. Arch also makes use of AUR which allows individuals or groups of people to maintain software to be compiled such as  paid proprietary software demos, the hurd kernel, or other packages not found in the official arch linux repos. You build it as you wish from the beginning, the community is smaller but contribute a lot to both the AUR and the extensive wiki. Arch is known as user-centric so it doesn&#039;t aim to be user friendly but with it, you can truly learn linux , it has a 100% free software fork, 32 bits optimized i686 distro so it perform better than most 32 bits distro, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Debian -</strong> Second oldest distro, base of most others distros, various branches with various ranges of stability. It is capable of using the bsd kernel as well as many others. one of the biggest packages repository build from source with some patching without depending on another distro. not 100% free software endorsed distro but don&#039;t include non-free content in the distro base just by more repositories, support any architecture, release only with there is no bug left so expect the biggest linux stabilty of Debian stable. you could download the repositories on dvds easily, could be build as you wish and customised easily, widely loved on servers</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu -</strong> most widely used distro, debian unstable based, the Linux Mint fork is on a hype, backed by a corporation, focus to be usable by beginners easily, may be critized for the touchscreen like interface of their main distro, release each 6 months with a long term support release each 2 years, massive community that don&#039;t contribute much, supported for 18 months for regular releases, 2-5 years for long term releases that apply only to the main distro, has a 100% free software distro fork, include a package manager where you could buy apps and games, always try to innovate so expect instability mostly on the main distro, the best hardware support out-of-the-box, biggest packages content</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gentoo -</strong> Source based/rolling release distro. Gentoo linux shares a great deal with Arch linux in that you start off with the bare minimum. Unlike Arch linux, Gentoo builds 99% of software from source code, which means if you want to install an application, you have to compile it first. The pro in this is you set USE flags to determine what is compiled and installed on your system which makes Gentoo totally optimized for your system and your hardware. Gentoo linux is capable on running on many different architectures, such as ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit, SPARC, mips, alpha, etc. Gentoo makes use of portage as its package manager which is very flexible and saves the user having to run multiple &quot;make&quot; jobs by hand. By default Gentoo makes use of the Gentoo patched linux kernel, but it can install many other kernels, such as the BSD kernel, xen kernel, vanilla etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Linux from scratch -</strong> just a manual to build every part of your setup, expect long compilation times, nearly perfectly optimisable for your hardware, may need a little work after upgrades when you use hardware with proprietary drivers, you build it as you want, very educative experience</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mandriva -</strong> now Mageia, focus for beginners</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUSE -</strong> Novell backed corporate distro, you pay for it but it got free derivates, the OpenSUSE fork is said to be one of the best Kde desktop implementation</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Puppy Linux -</strong> older pcs distro compatible with some others distros, could be run from ram at a blazing speed</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RedHat -</strong> most known corporate distro, 10 years of support, you pay for it but it got free derivates, the Fedora fork installer is one of the most featured</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slackware -</strong> oldest distro, minimal, use vanilla packages, stable, manage dependencies manually, could be support for 13 years or almost</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slitaz -</strong> older pc distros, 30Mb live cd download, the 1 Gb live dvd come with the repositories, could be run from ram at a blazing speed, most unix like distro</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As long as you stay near theses distros, you will have more support if needed, derivates are acceptable but it&#039;s far better if they are still compatible with the base distro to be usable even if it get discontinued, rolling releases distros are always updated and don&#039;t need releases, derivates from releases without rolling releases will need some patience before you could get new versions ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3- Archtecture :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Old computers use mostly 32 bits, new pcs of 5 years or less could use 64 bits except some, mobile devices uses arm, old macs use ppc, this could influence you distro choice mostly if you use arm or ppc, Debian and Gentoo support any architecture ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some distro uses 32 bits content on 64 bits for some applications that may need them, mostly old apps not upgraded for 64 bits, try to don&#039;t use them if possible and use a 64 bits equivalent if possible because it may slow the system a bit but it&#039;s negligeable and almost nothing, but this count on an old pc as always.32 bits run slower on 64 bits than on 32 bits, however some distro added x32 support to circonvent that like Gentoo, also pretty negligeable ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4- Desktop choice :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The interface that you distro will use, leading most of the standards, Freedesktop.org is to follow if you are not ready to be a little on your own ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Desktop manager/environment    Full-featured</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>GNOME (GTK), MATE, KDE (Qt), Trinity</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gnome -</strong> second oldest desktop environment, could have seemed stable but they always reinvented the wheel in background now it&#039;s more seen, create some new freedesktop specifications</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kde -</strong> oldest desktop manager, focus on making apps work together and on customisations, could be used on Windows</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mid-range</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>CDE (Motif), Xfce (GTK), IRIX Interactive Desktop (Motif)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Xfce -</strong> follow opendesktop standards, don&#039;t try to reinvent the wheel so they use existing technologies without making others, don&#039;t impose much to use theirs apps, try to stay relatively lightweight ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lightweight</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>EDE (FLTK), Étoilé (GNUstep), LXDE (GTK), Razor-qt (Qt), Mezzo, ROX, UDE, Sugar</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lxde -</strong> maked from Xfce code so it, focus on independants lightweight applications, lightweight and very energy efficient, use Openbox WM as backend and you could switch to *box Wms easily when experienced enough with it, fairly new but his code base make it more stable than expected, you could mix apps from it on any desktop without slowing your system much ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Razor-Qt -</strong> Lightweight, come from Kde with focus on simplicity and ease of use, recommanded to use Openbox with it, fairly new could be less stable but using known code make it more stable than it should ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sugar -</strong> focus to be usable 5-12 years childs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shell</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Unity, GNOME Shell, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Windows manager Full-featured</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Enlightenment, AfterStep, Compiz, KWin, Metacity, Mutter, Sawfish, Window Maker</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Enlightenment -</strong> Try to bring bells and whistles on very low specs hardware</p>
<p>Lightweight</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>awesome, Blackbox, Fluxbox, FVWM, IceWM, JWM, Openbox, twm, WindowLab</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Openbox -</strong> could be used as backend for most desktop environnements to make them faster than their original window manager, try to follow freedesktop standards</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Minimalistic</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>amiwm, cwm, dwm, ratpoison, wmii, xmonad</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CLI</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>ash • Bash • BusyBox • csh • dash • es shell • fish • ksh • psh • rc • rsh • Sash • Scsh • sh • tcsh • Thompson shell • zsh</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note 1 :</strong> You have to accept the philosophy of your desktop manager if you use one, this way you won&#039;t have troubles with it when it change, Window manager are independant so they keep you safe from unwanted changes, the lighter you choose the faster you get, all have their way to be and to be used so read a little, try them before you install a distro, it may drive your distro choice but all distros could use any of them ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note 2 :</strong> try to don&#039;t mix Qt, GTK, FLTK, GNUstep, Motif, Xfce types apps, don&#039;t that may slower your system a little, could not be relevant for powerful computers but watch for that on older pcs, Lxde apps try stay independant so it don&#039;t really count.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5- Use of distros and why most distro could almost do the same things :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>General use -</strong> a desktop with a few apps</p>
<p><strong>Education -</strong> Stellarium, Gcompris, Tuxpaint, *OpenDNS*</p>
<p><strong>Firewall -</strong> spamassasin, clamtk, *OpenDNS*, OpenVPN, OpenSSL, iptables</p>
<p><strong>100% free software -</strong> kernel-libre, gnash, lightspark</p>
<p><strong>Gaming -</strong> wine, lutris, desura, playonlinux, djl, gelide, stream my game</p>
<p><strong>Live session -</strong> *to ram option*, flash player, codecs, drivers, portable apps</p>
<p><strong>Multimedia -</strong> realtime kernel, cinerella, ardour, cinepaint, blender, inkscape</p>
<p><strong>Htpcs -</strong> mythtv, xbmc</p>
<p><strong>Netbooks -</strong> lightweight desktop, lxlauncher, midori/epiphany for webapps</p>
<p><strong>Old pcs -</strong> lightweight desktop, mplayer, abiword, gnumeric, pcmanfm, midori, dillo</p>
<p><strong>Privacy -</strong> tor, truecrypt, *https everywhere*</p>
<p><strong>Rescue -</strong> gparted, ntfs-3g, clamtk</p>
<p><strong>Server -</strong> apache, mysql, php, php my admin, webmin</p>
<p><strong>Voip -</strong> ekiga, skype, asterisk, openvpnMac-like - cairo-dock, awn, docky, slingshot</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6- When forks are decents :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fork or derivates distros maybe worth a look in some case, mostly for special uses like Framakey ubuntu-fr remix, if they help to install an harder distro easily like Bridge-Linux for Archlinux or Sabayon for Gentoo, if they come in with the bare minimal like k/l/ubuntu slim remix that come just with a minimal graphical interface with apps just enough to build your desktop on it as you wish easily and in some cases if it install the desktop or window manager of choice, other than that, you lose your time and another distro may do the same for you easily by messing a little ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7- Applications choices :</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it come to apps, the choice is wide and even a less usable/fonctional choice may be better in the end depending of your needs, let see some things that may drive your choices ...You could get packages from others distros compatible with your distro by using alien but don&#039;t expect it to always work well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most desktop environments come with applications, some of the most used applications come with Kde, Gnome, Xfce, Lxde ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>License :</strong> 100% free software mean that you will be able to use the app forever or almost if you have knowledge and time to keep it alive, proprietary software or restricted licenses software may mean that your application may die one day ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weight :</strong> Want speed, even command lines apps could be now pretty usable by beginners, lightweight GUI apps come second, command line and lightweight apps mean however less fonctionalities but well used they compare easily with regular apps, for example Mplayer make you view videos on almost nothing, MPD make you listen music in command line so if you switch users, restart xorg or work without GUI it will stay open for your pleasure ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>App type :</strong> As said before, it&#039;s not recommanded to fit many types of apps, it could not fit aestheticly with your setup and slow it down, some apps may don&#039;t have any alternatives but try to keep an eye on that, they&#039;re also great on Windows when you travel a lot or for less used apps to don&#039;t slow your system and for privacy, they keep your settings so you&#039;re at home anywhere ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note 1 :</strong> You could also use apps from Windows with various solutions, your mileage may vary, they could be far slower, to don&#039;t get it slower, you may try portable apps ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note 2 :</strong> There&#039;s some tools to make an app from website *webapp*, so you could include you prefered online app easily, they open on a browser but you don&#039;t have to put the link or remember the link, you need a web browser able to make web apps *Chrome/Chromium/Iron/Epiphany/Midori*, just take care because they aren&#039;t usable offline but it may make a desktop far lighter without losing the ease of use, just watch your internet connection bandwith, theses web apps are just web pages so they are usable on any operating system ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note 3 :</strong> Some apps could be prefered because that they are usable on most operating system, so you will fell at home almost anywhere, they&#039;re named cross-platform applications ...</p>
