            <p>* To-do list * [add yours ...]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Compare desktop managers and windows managers</p>
<p>- Corrections</p>
<p>- Describe distro bases</p>
<p>- Show that most distro could do what others does easily</p>
<p>- When forks are decents</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1- The distro base type is important :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Packages *Deb, rpm, and others* or sources ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to update easily and fast, packages are for you, most distro uses deb packages derivated from Debian and the other bigger part uses rpm packages derivated from Redhat ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don&#039;t care much about time to update and want pure performance over ease of use, sources may be suited for you ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2- Base distros to watch :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Archlinux *rolling release distro*</p>
<p>Debian *2nd oldest distro*</p>
<p>Ubuntu *debian based*</p>
<p>Gentoo *sources based/rolling release distro*</p>
<p>Linux from scratch *you build every part of your setup*</p>
<p>Mandriva *now Mageia*</p>
<p>SUSE *Novell backed corporate distro*</p>
<p>Puppy Linux *older pcs distro compatible with some others distros*</p>
<p>RedHat *most known corporate distro*</p>
<p>Slackware *oldest distro*</p>
<p>Slitaz *older pc distros*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As long as you stay near theses distros, you will have more support if needed, derivates are acceptable but it&#039;s far better if they are still compatible with the base distro to be usable even if it get discontinued, rolling releases distros are always updated and don&#039;t need releases, derivates from releases without rolling releases will need some patience before you could get new versions ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3- Archtecture :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Old computers use mostly 32 bits, new pcs of 5 years or less could use 64 bits except some, mobile devices uses arm, old macs use ppc, this could influence you distro choice mostly if you use arm or ppc, Debian and Gentoo support any architecture ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4- Desktop choice :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Desktop manager    Full-featured</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GNOME (GTK), MATE, KDE (Qt), Trinity</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mid-range</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CDE (Motif), Xfce (GTK), IRIX Interactive Desktop (Motif)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lightweight</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EDE (FLTK), Étoilé (GNUstep), LXDE (GTK), Razor-qt (Qt), Mezzo, ROX, UDE, Sugar</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shell</p>

<p>Unity, GNOME Shell, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>amiwm, cwm, dwm, ratpoison, wmii, xmonad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CLI</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ash • Bash • BusyBox • csh • dash • es shell • fish • ksh • psh • rc • rsh • Sash • Scsh • sh • tcsh • Thompson shell • zsh</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Note 1 : You have to accept the philosophy of your desktop manager if you use one, this way you won&#039;t have troubles with it when it change, Window manager are independant so they keep you safe from unwanted changes, the lighter you choose the faster you get, all have their way to be and to be used so read a little, try them before you install a distro, it may drive your distro choice but all distros could use any of them ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Note 2 : try to don&#039;t mix Qt, GTK, FLTK, GNUstep, Motif, Xfce types apps, don&#039;t that may slower your system a little, could not be relevant for powerful computers but watch for that on older pcs, Lxde apps try stay independant so it don&#039;t really count.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5- Use of distros :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>General use</p>
<p>Clusters</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Firewall</p>
<p>Forensics</p>
<p>100% free software</p>
<p>Gaming</p>
<p>Live session</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p>Multimedia</p>
<p>Htpcs</p>
<p>Netbooks</p>
<p>Old pcs</p>
<p>Privacy</p>
<p>Rescue</p>
<p>Server</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>Voip</p>
<p>Thin client</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that all distros could do anything if you take time to configure them properly, some may be easier to start from ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6- Applications choices :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it come to apps, the choice is wide and even a less usable/fonctional choice may be better in the end depending of your needs, let see some things that may drive your choices ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>License : 100% free software mean that you will be able to use the app forever or almost if you have knowledge and time to keep it alive, proprietary software or restricted licenses software may mean that your application may die one day ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Weight : Want speed, even command lines apps could be now pretty usable by beginners, lightweight GUI apps come second, command line and lightweight apps mean however less fonctionalities but well used they compare easily with regular apps, for example Mplayer make you view videos on almost nothing, MPD make you listen music in command line so if you switch users, restart xorg or work without GUI it will stay open for your pleasure ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>App type : As said before, it&#039;s not recommanded to fit many types of apps, it could not fit aestheticly with your setup and slow it down, some apps may don&#039;t have any alternatives but try to keep an eye on that, they&#039;re also great on Windows when you travel a lot or for less used apps to don&#039;t slow your system and for privacy, they keep your settings so you&#039;re at home anywhere ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note 1 : You could also use apps from Windows with various solutions, your mileage may vary, they could be far slower, to don&#039;t get it slower, you may try portable apps ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note 2 : There&#039;s some tools to make an app from website *webapp*, so you could include you prefered online app easily, they open on a browser but you don&#039;t have to put the link or remember the link, you need a web browser able to make web apps *Chrome/Chromium/Iron/Epiphany/Midori*, just take care because they aren&#039;t usable offline but it may make a desktop far lighter without losing the ease of use, just watch your internet connection bandwith, theses web apps are just web pages so they are usable on any operating system ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note 3 : Some apps could be prefered because that they are usable on most operating system, so you will fell at home almost anywhere, they&#039;re named cross-platform applications ...</p>
