What makes the differences are package management, default desktop environment, frequency of updates, default software collection and the level of user&#039;s knowledge to use the distribution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most available distributions are different in the aspects above, so generally you are always moving in same sandbox, just with different preferences.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>See here for an article about chooing your first Distro http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/18/picking_a_linux_distro</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Arch Linux (</strong>Beginners: ease of use 3/5 | ease of installation: 2/5<strong>):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Package manager: pacman (binary)</li>\n<li>Default desktop environment: none</li>\n<li>Documentation: good</li>\n<li>Community modified kernel: yes</li>\n<li>Installation in: shell</li>\n<li>Additional package repos: AUR - User driven package repository, with  possibility to add your own package (or version of already existing  package).</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>PROS:</p>\n<ul><li>Usage of vanilla software versions (eg. installed in default locations).</li>\n<li>Methodical package names.

It allows one to exactly specify what  applications will be installed, and what features should they support  (eg. image viewer-png,jpg,...). By default, it includes only most needed  utilities to perform basic installation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pardus linux (</strong>Beginners: ease of use 4/5 | ease of installation: 5/5<strong>):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Package manager: Pisi\u00a0</li>\n<li>Central configuration GUI: Pisi-Package Manager</li>\n<li>Package Type: .pisi</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Default desktop environment: KDE (gnome 3 possible)</li>\n<li>Documentation: Middle</li>\n<li>Community modified kernel: yes</li>\n<li>Installation in: Yali installation manager</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>PROS:</p>\n<ul><li>Very stable and integrated KDE environment</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Comar makes PC faster and lets programs interact better with each other</li>\n<li>Has its own integrated software</li>\n<li>Great hardware support and configuration manager for video drivers</li>\n<li>Kaptan welcomes very user friendly the new users at your first login</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTRAS:</p>\n<ul><li>Small repo&#039;s</li>\n<li>Pardus sometimes has a hard time with the API&#039;s of some Laptop models</li>\n<li>Not so well-known --&gt; less support</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pardus is a Linux distro that fights for its freedom. Unlike most  other distro&#039;s, its not based upon another Linux Distro. This makes  Pardus very unique and different. With Pardus, comes a lot of pre  installed codecs and software, which makes it an good beginners Linux  distro.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ubuntu Family (</strong>Beginners: ease of use 4/5 | ease of installation: 5/5<strong>):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Package manager: Software Center</li>\n<li>Package type: .deb</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Default desktop environment: depends on the family member (GNOME, KDE etc)</li>\n<li>Documentation: perfect</li>\n<li>Community modified kernel: yes</li>\n<li>Installation in: GUI</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Additional package repos: Personal Package Archives (PPA), GetDeb repos -&gt; http://www.getdeb.net/welcome/</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>PROS:</p>\n<ul><li>Good and easy control over the system configuration</li>\n<li>Perfectly documented and supported</li>\n<li>A huge number of packages available, most of them recent versions</li>\n<li>Very user oriented and preferred by novice users</li>\n<li>The different family members are faced towards easing the user with  their choice depending on if they like more KDE (Kubuntu), LXDE  (Lubuntu), XFCE (Xubuntu), server edition etc -&gt;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Ubuntu-based</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONS:</p>\n<ul><li>Video driver support is by default to open source drivers.  Additional steps are needed to add most recent propriety graphic  drivers.</li>\n<li>Some propriety codecs/apps are not included by default, so  additional steps for using them are needed (like libdvdcss2 for example)</li>\n<li>In the latest releases (above 11.04) a lot of very recent versions  applications are included, introducing serious bugs and speed penalties  (incl. Unity)</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>DISPUTABLE:</p>\n<ul><li>Often version releases. The good thing about them are that you  have always almost the latest versions of the different packages  including the base ones like KDE, GNOME, X etc... The bad side is that  sometimes these latest versions are still buggy at the time of the  release, so at the moment of release sometimes it may contain bugs.</li>\n<li>Unity - the ease of use and the user friendliness of Unity is  disliked by a lot of users. It changes the habits of old users and they  claim it is more suitable for tablets. But of course Unity has its fans.</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ubuntu family consists of Debian based distributions, that are aimed  at users&#039; ease of use, flexibility, recent packages and perfect support.  It has a huge number of users, thus making the Ubuntu family a very  well supported one. The different family members are faced towards  easing the user with  their choice depending on if they like more KDE  (Kubuntu), LXDE  (Lubuntu), XFCE (Xubuntu), server edition etc -&gt;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Ubuntu-based.
