            <p>BSD lisence is Bsd when Linux mostly use GPL, there&#039;s a group of leaders not just one, it focus on a full operating system not just a kernel but note that applications are often on both, it&#039;s more cohesive since the base is created all together, it use more source packages, it&#039;s more stable overall so less prone to bugs and feature a quite impressive security, sadly it don&#039;t shine on new hardware when Bsd support hardware sometimes years after Linux and to finish the user base is more technical on average than the linux one.<br /></p>
