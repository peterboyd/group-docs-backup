I am putting it together because the documentation surrounding UEFI was pretty poor, feel free to improve the formatting or add tips and such</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>First you need to obtain a UEFI bootable medium (I used Ubuntu 12.10 for this and wrote it to a memory stick). You should go into the UEFI BIOS and boot the memory stick in UEFI mode. Before beginning, I recommend going into the Ubuntu Software centre and installing something like gdisk as GPT partitioning is a must. </li>\n<li>If the computer came with windows pre installed then there should already be a Windows EFI Fat32 partition but if you decide to nuke windows then you must create a new one. The EFI partition <strong>must</strong> be the first partition you create/have. On a gentoo only system, a basic partition layout will be something like:-\u00a0 EFI Partition - 100 to 200MB; Linux Swap partition - half of your memory; root file system - whatever you want; home - whatever you want; etc. If you are using gdisk, you can follow the fdisk instructions on the gentoo wiki and set the code to your partition type (EF00 is an EFI partition type; 8200 is a linux swap partition type and 8300 is general linux filesystem). The EFI partition must be fat32 so if you are creating it as a new partition, make sure you run mkfs.vfat /dev/sdXn where sdXn is the partition (sda1 in my instance). </li>\n<li>For mounting the partitions in gentoo, you must create /mnt/gentoo on your ubuntu livecd and follow the instructions in the gentoo handbook. Follow the handbook for mounting the root filesystem e.g mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/gentoo but for the EFI partition, create /mnt/gentoo/boot/efi and do mount /dev/sdXn /mnt/gentoo/boot/efi. Continue to mount /dev and /sys as you normally would. </li>\n<li>Once it comes to kernel cofiguration, there are certain options you need enabled for UEFI to function properly (most are enabled by default at the time of this document). They are as follows;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Processor types and features -&gt; EFI runtime service support [*]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Build a relocateable kernel [*]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Device Drivers -&gt; Graphics Support -&gt; Support for Frame Buffer Devices -&gt; Enable Firmware EDID [*]\u00a0 <strong>and </strong>EFI based frame buffer support [*]; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Device Drivers -&gt; Graphics Support -&gt; Console Display Driver Support -&gt; Frame Buffer Console Support [*] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Firmware Drivers\u00a0 -&gt; EFI Variable Support via sysfs [*] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 File Systems -&gt; Partition Types -&gt; Advanced Partition Selection [*] <strong>and </strong>EFI GUID Partition Support. \u00a0 And that is it for the minimum kernel requirements concerning UEFI, don&#039;t bother enabling vesafb for framebuffer support as EFI will override it. </li>\n<li>Keep following the gentoo handbook until you get to the bootloader part. Gentoo uses Grub 0.97 by default which is unfortunate for us as we need Grub 2 so do &quot;echo &quot;GRUB_PLATFORMS=\\ &quot;efi-64&quot; &quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/make.conf&quot;. Next we need to unmask grub 2 so do &quot;nano /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords&quot; and put in &quot;sys-boot/grub&quot; &lt;new line&gt; &quot;sys-boot/efibootmgr&quot;. Obviously don&#039;t type in &lt;new line&gt;. </li>\n<li>We can now emerge grub so go ahead and do it. Grub 2 is noticeably more annoying than grub 0.97 in that everything has changed so first you want to do &quot;nano /etc/default/grub&quot;\u00a0 and from here, you can modify kernel paramenters and such. I didn&#039;t modify this file at all during my first UEFI installation so it isn&#039;t a necessity but the documentation on grub 2 is very good. </li>\n<li>Now we need to actually install grub2 to the corresponding partitions we have set up so you can do something similar to this (modify it at your will);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &quot;grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --modules=&quot;part_gpt part_msdos linux boot lvm&quot; --efi-directory=/boot/efi /dev/sdXn&quot;. The next command you need to do is &quot;grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg&quot;. Please note that the --modules= section is not necessary but it is good protection in case your /boot partition can&#039;t be found. That should be it! you can now run &quot;efibootmgr -v&quot; to ensure it has been successfully set up so now you can follow the gentoo handbook on restarting your system and pray it actually boots. </li>\n</ol><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy gentooing!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>sources:-</p>\n<p>http://xtothei.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/gentoo-uefi/</p>\n<p>http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/UEFI</p>\n<p>http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/</p>", "subject": "Gentoo linux UEFI install", "id": "10152451835410019", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yi/r/-64q65AWgXb.png"}
