TITLE: Linux First Steps and "Rules"

<br><br><p>A lot of people here ask questions about different aspects of Linux.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since answering these questions again and again is a tedious work, i will try to summarize some of the important topics that may be of interest to new Linux users...</p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all if you decided to test Linux, choose you distro and download/burn its LiveCD version (if such version is offered). That will help you in your decision.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Choosing the right distro is usually hard, because you get quite a bunch of opinions which distro is better, which sucks etc...</p>
<p>But these links may help you choose:</p>

<p></p>
<p>After you install your distribution and get a bit acquainted with it you may like to have a look at some of the following:</p>
<p>==============================================================</p>
<ol><li>Make sure you only add to your repositories trusted sources </li>
<li>Make sure you have activated all your distro&#039;s security updates and general updates repositories</li>
<li>You may add some additional repositories that offer new versions of some packages like KDE, some multimedia programs etc</li>

<p>      Note that most repos in SuSE are available under &quot;add repository&quot; and selecting &quot;Community Repository&quot;.</p>

</ul><p></p>
<ol><li>Avoid installing unnecessary services. Like if you do not intend accessing your computer remotely, do not install the SSH server etc</li>
<li>Never give your root password (or root access) to anyone you do not entirely trust</li>
<li>Do not run scripts from unknown sources especially do not run them as root. Same goes for installing packages from untrusted sources... </li>
</ol><p></p>

<p>Finally if you feel lost among the pile of applications that Linux offers you, and you need some help in finding alternatives/analogues of you favorite MS Windows programs.... You may consult the Linux Alternative Project (formerly the Linux Equivalent Project) -&gt; http://www.linuxalt.com/</p>
