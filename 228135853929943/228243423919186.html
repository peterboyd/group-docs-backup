TITLE: General Purpose Linux Links Every Penguinisto Should Know

<br><br><p>This is a page for general links which will work in any distribution. It assumes you&#039;ve already got Linux installed and you know about general care and feeding of your distribution of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GETTING HELP: Have a question? Type &quot;man subject&quot; first on the command line. Q to quit. Replace subject with what you&#039;re interested in suchas &quot;man apache&quot; or &quot;man cron&quot;. --help also produces the expected set of results.</p>

<p>BASH programming intro:http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html</p>
<p>BASH is the general purpose Linux shell which has become the standard of the community. If you&#039;re coming from ksh or ash, it will feel similar. You can make your life a lot easier if you learn how to script one offs on the command line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PERL programming intro:http://perldoc.perl.org/perlintro.html</p>
<p>PERL became the crossover language for a lot of people (including myself) where we had to write-once-run-everywhere among disparate Linux systems. Perl is available on almost all *NIX similar boxes. If it&#039;s not written in BASH, it&#039;s probably written in PERL. (If you&#039;re wondering &quot;Can I script for a Mac? Look for perl).</p>

<p>Editing Files:http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/Tutor/vi.html ORhttp://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/</p>
<p>I prefer vi, but discussions on this topic is the stuff of legend. Both vi and emacs are installed in major *NIX systems. Pick one, learn it and love it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What&#039;s the code look like OR where did all this come from:http://www.gentoo.org/</p>
<p>The last living source distro with any serious community (slackware - you break my heart). Want to tune the distro to 11? Read up. Think building a kernel is kool? You can probably learn here. Glutton for punishment or simply want to have compiler races? Great! Think Linux would run awesome on your ATARI 800? Awesome!</p>

<p>You have a problem that you cannot fix?: Try to get help from http://www.linuxquestions.org/ or from your distro&#039;s main site forums section...</p>
