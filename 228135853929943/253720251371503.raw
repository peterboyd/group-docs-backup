And it was LIVE!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, you&#039;re a complete noob and looking to try a GNU/Linux operating  system for the first time. However, you&#039;ve encountered a small bump on  the road. You&#039;ve got questions, and probably a lot of them. But your  first question probably would be, &quot;Which one should I use&quot; and &quot;What&#039;s  the best distribution for a beginner like me?&quot;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would be difficult to answer these questions because, for one, we  really don&#039;t know you that well to determine how much of a beginner you  are, despite the neophyte nature of your inquiry. And two, you may have a  specific reason for wanting to use GNU/Linux, and it would be hard to  know exactly which one would best suit your needs; you may want to use  GNU/Linux for general or system administrative/programming purposes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, chances are, you&#039;re looking for a distribution that would  allow you to test the system without much configuration; a system that  would work &quot;out-of-the-box,&quot; and maybe allow you to learn the system  overtime as needed. Also, you would like to know how the system looks  and run without having to uninstall your existing operating system  (which would most likely be Windows ;) ).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, there is one sure way you can be able to test a GNU/Linux  system for your desktop or laptop without worrying about messing up your  current system and data. It&#039;s called the <strong>Live CD!</strong> It&#039;s  a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM that has a working GNU/Linux system installed so  that all you have to do is insert it into your CD/DVD drive, restart  your computer, and then your computer will boot from the disk and launch  the system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds great, doesn&#039;t it?! Wait, there&#039;s still a little problem:  which distribution can you choose?  Fortunately, because you&#039;re a noob,  we&#039;ve compiled a brief list of distributions (distro for short) that  provide a Live CD to test and even install GNU/Linux if you really like  it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But first you need to know that when you select a distro to download,  you&#039;ll actually be downloading a special type of file called a <strong>CD image file</strong> (.iso). This file needs to be burned onto a CD (or DVD, depending on  its size), and for that you&#039;ll need a few blank CDs and a special  software called a <strong>CD burner</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A popular for Windows is called <strong>ImgBurn</strong>: http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that you have everything you need, check out the list of popular GNU/Linux distros below:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Ubuntu is a complete desktop GNU/Linux operating system, freely  available with both community and professional support. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is an  ancient African word (Bantu, specifically speaking), meaning &quot;humanity  to others.&quot;</p>\n<p>(Hint: whenever you go to a download page of a distro, you may not  see where it would say, &quot;Download Live CD.&quot; Some distros, like Ubuntu,  provide a Live CD and Installation CD all in one.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/ubuntu-small.png http://www.ubuntu.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Linux Mint </strong></p>\n<p>Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distribution whose goal is to provide a  more complete out-of-the-box experience by including browser plugins,  media codecs, support for DVD playback, Java and other components. It  also adds a custom desktop and menus, several unique configuration  tools, and a web-based package installation interface. Linux Mint is  compatible with Ubuntu software repositories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/mint-small.png http://linuxmint.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Fedora </strong></p>\n<p>Fedora is GNU/Linux system that basically picked up where Red Hat  Linux 9 left. The Fedora Project is an openly-developed project designed  by Red Hat, open for general participation, led by a meritocracy,  following a set of project objectives. The goal of The Fedora Project is  to work with the Linux community to build a complete, general purpose  operating system exclusively from open source software.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/fedora-small.png http://fedoraproject.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Debian </strong></p>\n<p>Meet the mother of Ubuntu and the grandmother of Linux Mint and other  Ubuntu-based (see below). In fact, don&#039;t be surprise to find a lot of  distros based on it. Debian GNU/Linux was first announced in 1993. Its  founder, Ian Murdock, envisaged the creation of a completely  non-commercial project developed by hundreds of volunteer developers in  their spare time. With skeptics far outnumbering optimists at the time,  it was destined to disintegrate and collapse, but the reality was very  different. Debian not only survived, it thrived and, in less than a  decade, it became the largest Linux distribution and possibly the  largest collaborative software project ever created!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/debian-small.png http://www.debian.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>openSUSE </strong></p>\n<p>openSUSE is a GNU/Linux system whose origins to back to 1992, when it  was called SuSE, &quot;Software und System Entwicklung.&quot; (Yes, it was  developed by Germans, so get over it, lol). openSUSE has a large  following of satisfied users. The principal reason for openSUSE getting  high marks from its users are pleasant and polished desktop environments  (KDE and GNOME), excellent system administration utility (YaST), and,  for those who buy the boxed edition, some of the best printed  documentation available with any distribution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/suse-small.png http://www.opensuse.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>PCLinuxOS </strong></p>\n<p>PCLinuxOS is a user-friendly Linux distribution with out-of-the-box  support for many popular graphics and sound cards, as well as other  peripheral devices. The bootable live CD provides an easy-to-use  graphical installer and the distribution sports a wide range of popular  applications for the typical desktop user, including browser plugins and  full multimedia playback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/pclinuxos-small.png http://www.pclinuxos.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CentOS </strong></p>\n<p>Launched in late 2003, CentOS is a community project with the goals  of rebuilding the source code for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) into  an installable Linux distribution and to provide timely security updates  for all included software packages. To put in more bluntly, CentOS is a  RHEL clone. The only technical difference between the two distributions  is branding - CentOS replaces all Red Hat trademarks and logos with its  own. But the connection between RHEL and CentOS is not immediately  visible on the CentOS web site; due to trademark laws, Red Hat is  referred to as a &quot;Prominent North American Enterprise Linux Vendor&quot;,  instead of its proper name. Nevertheless, the relations between Red Hat  and CentOS remain amicable and many CentOS developers are in active  contact with Red Hat engineers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/centos-small.png http://www.centos.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mageia </strong></p>\n<p>Mageia might be the newest distribution on this list, but its roots  go back to July 1998 when Ga\u00ebl Duval launched Mandrake Linux. Mageia is a  fork of Mandriva Linux formed in September 2010 by former employees and  contributors to the popular French Linux distribution. Unlike Mandriva,  which is a commercial entity, the Mageia project is a community project  and a non-profit organization whose goal is to develop a free  Linux-based operating system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/mageia-small.png http://www.mageia.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Kubuntu </strong></p>\n<p>Kubuntu is a free, user-friendly Linux distribution based on KDE&#039;s (K  Desktop Environment) desktop software (which is why it&#039;s Ubuntu spelled  with a &quot;K&quot;) and on the award-winning Ubuntu operating system. It has a  biannual release cycle and at least 18 months of free security updates  for each release. Besides providing an up-to-date version of the KDE  desktop at the time of the release, the project also releases updated  KDE packages throughout the lifetime of each release.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/kubuntu-small.png http://www.kubuntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Xbuntu </strong></p>\n<p>Xubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. Unlike its parent,  however, Xubuntu uses the light-weight Xfce desktop environment (which  is why it&#039;s Ubuntu spelled with an &quot;X&quot;) and is optimized for lower-end  machines. The distribution includes only GTK+ applications where  possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screetshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/xubuntu-small.png http://www.xubuntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lubuntu </strong></p>\n<p>Lubuntu is a fast, lightweight and energy-saving variant of Ubuntu  using the LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) desktop (I think  you get the idea behind its spelling). It is intended to have  low-resource system requirements and is designed primarily for netbooks,  mobile devices and older PCs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/lubuntu-small.png http://lubuntu.net/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Fubuntu </strong></p>\n<p>Fuduntu, originally Fedora-based, but later forked, is a Linux  distribution that earns its name by its ambition to fit somewhere  in-between Fedora and Ubuntu. It is designed to be aesthetically  pleasing, and is optimized for netbook and other portable computers, as  well as general-purpose desktop machines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/fuduntu-small.png http://www.fuduntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Puppy Linux</strong></p>\n<p>Puppy Linux is yet another Linux distribution. What&#039;s different here  is that Puppy is extraordinarily small, yet quite full-featured. Puppy  boots into a ramdisk and, unlike live CD distributions that have to keep  pulling stuff off the CD, it loads into RAM. This means that all  applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to user input  instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a flash card or any  USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240 Superdisk, floppy  disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a multisession formatted  CD-RW/DVD-RW to save everything back to the CD/DVD with no hard drive  required at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/puppy-small.png http://www.puppylinux.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ArchBang Linux </strong></p>\n<p>ArchBang Linux is a lightweight distribution based on Arch Linux.  Using the Openbox window manager, it is fast, up-to-date and suitable  for both desktop and portable systems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/archbang-small.png http://www.archbang.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A Live CD is a great way to test several different distros out to  find which one, or more, suits your needs the best. Keep in mind that  this list is very short, for there are a lot of distros out there, and  unfortunately, not many of them provide Live CDs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The links to the screenshots provided are images of &quot;desktop  environments.&quot; A Desktop Environment (DE) is software that provides a  Graphical User Interface (GUI) to control a computer system by providing  common tools such as windows, icons, menus, and pointers. There are  several desktop environments, the most popular are:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GNOME</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.gnome.org</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>KDE</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.kde.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Xfce</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.xfce.org</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>LXDE</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.lxde.org</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the distros mentioned may provide one of the DE&#039;s as a default.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, what&#039;s important to note is to never judge a distro simply by looking at whatever DE it provides in a Live CD or upon installation (similar to the old saying, &quot;Never judge a book by its cover&quot;). Although  distros like Xubuntu and Lubuntu provide Xfce and LXDE, respectively,  as a default, a DE is not hard-wired to a system, and thus can be  changed. Distros, such as Debian and CentOS, provide many of the popular  DE&#039;s in their repository, allowing you to try different DE&#039;s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We suggest that you take a little time to research as many of the  various distros as you can to find the one that&#039;s right for you.
