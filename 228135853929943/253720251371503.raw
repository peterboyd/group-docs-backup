And it was LIVE!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, you&#039;re a complete noob and looking to try a GNU/Linux operating</p>\n<p>system for the first time. However, you&#039;ve encountered a small bump on</p>\n<p>the road. You&#039;ve got questions, and probably a lot of them. But you&#039;re</p>\n<p>most common would be, &quot;Which one should I use&quot; and &quot;What&#039;s the best</p>\n<p>distribution for a beginner like me?&quot;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would be difficult to answer these questions because, for one, we</p>\n<p>really don&#039;t know you that well to determine how much of a beginner you</p>\n<p>are, despite the neophyte nature of your inquiry. And two, you may have a</p>\n<p>specific reason for wanting to use GNU/Linux, and it would be hard to</p>\n<p>know exactly which one would best suit your needs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, chances are, you&#039;re looking for a distribution that would</p>\n<p>allow you to test the system without much configuration; a system that</p>\n<p>would work &quot;out-of-the-box,&quot; and maybe allow you to learn the system</p>\n<p>overtime as needed. Also, you would like to know how the system looks</p>\n<p>and run without having to uninstall your existing operating system</p>\n<p>(which would most likely be Windows ;) ).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, there is one sure way you can be able to test a GNU/Linux</p>\n<p>system for your desktop or laptop without worrying about messy up your</p>\n<p>current system and data. It&#039;s called the <strong>Live CD!</strong> It&#039;s a</p>\n<p>CD-ROM or DVD-ROM that has a working GNU/Linux sytem installed so that</p>\n<p>all you have to do is insert it into your CD/DVD drive, restart your</p>\n<p>computer, and then your computer will boot from the disk and launch the</p>\n<p>system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds great, doesn&#039;t it?! Wait, there&#039;s still a little problem:</p>\n<p>which distribution can you choose?  Fortunately, because you&#039;re a noob,</p>\n<p>we&#039;ve compiled a brief list of distributions (distro for short) that</p>\n<p>provide a Live CD to test and even install GNU/Linux if you really like</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But first you need to know that when you select a distro to download,</p>\n<p>you&#039;ll actually be downloading a special type of file called a <strong>CD image file</strong></p>\n<p>(.iso). This file needs to be burned onto a CD (or DVD, depending on</p>\n<p>its size), and for that you&#039;ll need a few blank CDs and a special</p>\n<p>software called a <strong>CD burner</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A popular for Windows is called <strong>ImgBurn</strong>: http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that you have everthing you need, check out the list of popular GNU/Linux distros below:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Ubuntu is a complete desktop GNU/Linux operating system, freely</p>\n<p>available with both community and professional support. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is an</p>\n<p>ancient African word (Bantu, specifically speaking), meaning &quot;humanity</p>\n<p>to others.&quot;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Hint: whenever you go to a download page of a distro, you may not</p>\n<p>see where it would say, &quot;Download Live CD.&quot; Some distros, like Ubuntu,</p>\n<p>provide a Live CD and Installation CD all in one.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/ubuntu-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.ubuntu.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Linux Mint </strong></p>\n<p>Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distribution whose goal is to provide a</p>\n<p>more complete out-of-the-box experience by including browser plugins,</p>\n<p>media codecs, support for DVD playback, Java and other components. It</p>\n<p>also adds a custom desktop and menus, several unique configuration</p>\n<p>tools, and a web-based package installation interface. Linux Mint is</p>\n<p>compatible with Ubuntu software repositories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/mint-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://linuxmint.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Fedora</strong></p>\n<p>Fedora is GNU/Linux system that basically picked up where Red Hat</p>\n<p>Linux 9 left. The Fedora Project is an openly-developed project designed</p>\n<p>by Red Hat, open for general participation, led by a meritocracy,</p>\n<p>following a set of project objectives. The goal of The Fedora Project is</p>\n<p>to work with the Linux community to build a complete, general purpose</p>\n<p>operating system exclusively from open source software.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/fedora-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://fedoraproject.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Debian</strong></p>\n<p>Meet the mother of Ubuntu and the grandmother of Linux Mint and other</p>\n<p>Ubuntu-based (see below). In fact, don&#039;t be surprise to find a lot of</p>\n<p>distros based on it. Debian GNU/Linux was first announced in 1993. Its</p>\n<p>founder, Ian Murdock, envisaged the creation of a completely</p>\n<p>non-commercial project developed by hundreds of volunteer developers in</p>\n<p>their spare time. With sceptics far outnumbering optimists at the time,</p>\n<p>it was destined to disintegrate and collapse, but the reality was very</p>\n<p>different. Debian not only survived, it thrived and, in less than a</p>\n<p>decade, it became the largest Linux distribution and possibly the</p>\n<p>largest collaborative software project ever created!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/debian-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.debian.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>openSUSE</strong></p>\n<p>openSUSE is a GNU/Linux system whose origins to back to 1992, when it</p>\n<p>was called SuSE, &quot;Software und System Entwicklung.&quot; (Yes, it was</p>\n<p>developed by Germans, so get over it, lol). openSUSE has a large</p>\n<p>following of satisfied users. The principal reason for openSUSE getting</p>\n<p>high marks from its users are pleasant and polished desktop environments</p>\n<p>(KDE and GNOME), excellent system administration utility (YaST), and,</p>\n<p>for those who buy the boxed edition, some of the best printed</p>\n<p>documentation available with any distribution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/suse-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.opensuse.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>PCLinuxOS</strong></p>\n<p>PCLinuxOS is a user-friendly Linux distribution with out-of-the-box</p>\n<p>support for many popular graphics and sound cards, as well as other</p>\n<p>peripheral devices. The bootable live CD provides an easy-to-use</p>\n<p>graphical installer and the distribution sports a wide range of popular</p>\n<p>applications for the typical desktop user, including browser plugins and</p>\n<p>full multimedia playback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/pclinuxos-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.pclinuxos.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CentOS</strong></p>\n<p>Launched in late 2003, CentOS is a community project with the goals</p>\n<p>of rebuilding the source code for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) into</p>\n<p>an installable Linux distribution and to provide timely security updates</p>\n<p>for all included software packages. To put in more bluntly, CentOS is a</p>\n<p>RHEL clone. The only technical difference between the two distributions</p>\n<p>is branding - CentOS replaces all Red Hat trademarks and logos with its</p>\n<p>own. But the connection between RHEL and CentOS is not immediately</p>\n<p>visible on the CentOS web site; due to trademark laws, Red Hat is</p>\n<p>referred to as a &quot;Prominent North American Enterprise Linux Vendor&quot;,</p>\n<p>instead of its proper name. Nevertheless, the relations between Red Hat</p>\n<p>and CentOS remain amicable and many CentOS developers are in active</p>\n<p>contact with Red Hat engineers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/slinks/centos-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.centos.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mageia</strong></p>\n<p>Mageia might be the newest distribution on this list, but its roots</p>\n<p>go back to July 1998 when Ga\u00ebl Duval launched Mandrake Linux. Mageia is a</p>\n<p>fork of Mandriva Linux formed in September 2010 by former employees and</p>\n<p>contributors to the popular French Linux distribution. Unlike Mandriva,</p>\n<p>which is a commercial entity, the Mageia project is a community project</p>\n<p>and a non-profit organisation whose goal is to develop a free</p>\n<p>Linux-based operating system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/mageia-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.mageia.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Kubuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Kubuntu is a free, user-friendly Linux distribution based on KDE&#039;s</p>\n<p>desktop software (which is why it&#039;s Ubuntu spelled with a &quot;K&quot;) and on</p>\n<p>the award-winning Ubuntu operating system. It has a biannual release</p>\n<p>cycle and at least 18 months of free security updates for each release.</p>\n<p>Besides providing an up-to-date version of the KDE desktop at the time</p>\n<p>of the release, the project also releases updated KDE packages</p>\n<p>throughout the lifetime of each release.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/kubuntu-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.kubuntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Xbuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Xubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. Unlike its parent,</p>\n<p>however, Xubuntu uses the light-weight Xfce desktop environment (which</p>\n<p>is why it&#039;s Ubuntu spelled with an &quot;X&quot;) and is optimised for lower-end</p>\n<p>machines. The distribution includes only GTK+ applications where</p>\n<p>possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screetshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/xubuntu-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.xubuntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lubuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Lubuntu is a fast, lightweight and energy-saving variant of Ubuntu</p>\n<p>using the LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) desktop (I think</p>\n<p>you get the idea behind its spelling). It is intended to have</p>\n<p>low-resource system requirements and is designed primarily for netbooks,</p>\n<p>mobile devices and older PCs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/lubuntu-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://lubuntu.net/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Fubuntu</strong></p>\n<p>Fuduntu, originally Fedora-based, but later forked, is a Linux</p>\n<p>distribution that earns its name by its ambition to fit somewhere</p>\n<p>in-between Fedora and Ubuntu. It is designed to be aesthetically</p>\n<p>pleasing, and is optimized for netbook and other portable computers, as</p>\n<p>well as general-purpose desktop machines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/fuduntu-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.fuduntu.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Puppy Linux</strong></p>\n<p>Puppy Linux is yet another Linux distribution. What&#039;s different here</p>\n<p>is that Puppy is extraordinarily small, yet quite full-featured. Puppy</p>\n<p>boots into a ramdisk and, unlike live CD distributions that have to keep</p>\n<p>pulling stuff off the CD, it loads into RAM. This means that all</p>\n<p>applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to user input</p>\n<p>instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a flash card or any</p>\n<p>USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240 Superdisk, floppy</p>\n<p>disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a multisession formatted</p>\n<p>CD-RW/DVD-RW to save everything back to the CD/DVD with no hard drive</p>\n<p>required at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/puppy-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.puppylinux.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ArchBand Linux</strong></p>\n<p>ArchBang Linux is a lightweight distribution based on Arch Linux.</p>\n<p>Using the Openbox window manager, it is fast, up-to-date and suitable</p>\n<p>for both desktop and portable systems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/archbang-small.png</p>\n<p>Main site: http://www.archbang.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A Live CD is a great way to test several different distros out to</p>\n<p>find which one, or more, suits your needs the best. Keep in mind that</p>\n<p>this list is very short, for there are a lot of distros out there.
