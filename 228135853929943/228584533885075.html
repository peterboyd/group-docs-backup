TITLE: Linux, Gaming and MS Windows Applications

<br><br><p>Many of us come from Windows or have a dual boot Linux/Windows system.</p>
<p>And the main interest in such situations is if they will be able to play their favorite MS Win games, if they will be able to run their favorite MS Win applications and so on in their Linux.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is not an easy answer to give, but some general &quot;rules&quot; apply...</p>
<ul><li>If you expect your MS win favorite game to work ok and this game is a very recent one having all the candies of DirectX etc... you may be disappointed.</li>
<li>Common applications and games like MS Office, IE explorer etc, usually work well in Linux.</li>
<li>Applications for controlling your mobile device (using vendor specific software like Samsung&#039;s Kies etc) usually do not work because of driver issues under emulation (this includes even VirtualBox and family). The good thing is that there are plenty of native Linux apps that do the job well.</li>
<li>There are some games that have their Linux binaries too, so you may look for a Linux binary in the download section of the main site of your game. Examples: Second Life, Minecraft (it&#039;s a Java app infact) etc</li>
<li>There are pretty much Linux native games, but do not expect too much from them in terms of graphics... consult the -&gt; http://www.lgdb.org and -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_gaming</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For running all your MS Win applications you may use:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>WINE</strong></p>
<p><strong>====</strong></p>
<p>Wine ( http://www.winehq.org ) lets you run Windows software on other operating systems.</p>
<p>With Wine, you can install and run these applications just like you would in Windows. Wine is still under active development so not every program works yet. But consult the Database of Wine if your application is supported -&gt; http://appdb.winehq.org/</p>
<p><em>Remember: always keep your Wine binaries latest version, so the chance of running the app of your choice to be greater.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>WINE: PLAY ON LINUX</strong></em></p>
<p><em>===================</em></p>
<p>Play on Linux (http://www.playonlinux.com/en) its Basically Based on wine. It offers you some &#039;scripts&#039; to let you install lots of games and other windows software more easily in wine. what these scripts do:</p>
<ul><li>Make a sort of &#039;bottle&#039; to install the best wine version for the specific game or program you want to install, so all your wine installations will be separated from each other. (This is due because of the fact that some games or drivers may affect other games or programs in the same wine Installation.)</li>
<li>Installs needed drivers, components or fonts.</li>
<li>Installs your game or program by downloading it from the internet, using a CD or using an .exe file</li>
<li>Makes shortcuts</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Note: <em>if you remove a &#039;bottle&#039; in Play on Linux, The whole wine installation in that bottle, with its game and drivers will be removed</em>. <em>Other wine installations will be unaffected.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>To fully understand how Play on Linux works and how you can install windows software with it, is written in the documentation --&gt; http://www.playonlinux.com/en/page-2-Documentation.html</p>

<p><strong>VIRTUALBOX</strong></p>
<p><strong>=========</strong></p>
<p>VirtualBox ( https://www.virtualbox.org/ ) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. It is an extremely feature rich and high performance product.</p>
<p>Actually you may look at it as your virtual brand new PC box, that needs an OS to be installed. This means you need a Windows/Linux/Mac installation media, that you will use to install your OS on the virtual PC. This virtual PC will actually run in your Linux... Thus the bad side of this is that it requires more resources i.e. a powerful real PC.</p>
<p>Another bad side - do not expect games to work ok.. the 3D support is there but still not that mature...</p>
<p>More detailed instructions on how to <strong><em>install Windows in a Linux VirtualBox</em></strong> environment you can find here -&gt; http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>For Ubuntu family (as in Debian and the main RPM distributions)</em></strong> follow these steps for installing VirtualBox (VB):</p>
<ol><li>Add the VB repo as described here -&gt; https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads (look in the section &quot;<em>Debian-based Linux distributions</em>&quot; or the &quot;<em>RPM-based Linux distributions&quot; section depending on your distribution)</em></li>
<li>In your package manager select the latest VB package (not the OSE one) and install it.</li>
<li>Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and Download the <em>Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack </em>that should be the same version number as your VB that you have installed from your package manager</li>
<li>Click on the downloaded Extension pack file (alternatively you can  install it from the Options menu of VB itself) so it can be  autoinstalled in your VB application.</li>
<li>Next follow the steps described in the tutorial link above (http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html)</li>
