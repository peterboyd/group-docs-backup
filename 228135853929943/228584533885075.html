            <p>Many of us come from Windows or have a dual boot Linux/Windows system.</p>
<p>And the main interest in such situations is if they will be able to play their favorite MS Win games, if they will be able to run their favorite MS Win applications and so on in their Linux.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is not an easy answer to give, but some general &quot;rules&quot; apply...</p>
<ul><li>If you expect your MS win favorite game to work ok and this game is a very recent one having all the candies of DirectX etc... you may be disappointed.</li>
<li>Common applications and games like MS Office, IE explorer etc, usually work well in Linux.</li>
<li>Applications for controlling your mobile device (using vendor specific software like Samsung&#039;s Kies etc) usually do not work because of driver issues under emulation (this includes even VirtualBox and family). The good thing is that there are plenty of native Linux apps that do the job well.</li>
<li>There are some games that have their Linux binaries too, so you may look for a Linux binary in the download section of the main site of your game. Examples: Second Life, Minecraft (it&#039;s a Java app infact) etc</li>
<li>There are pretty much Linux native games, but do not expect too much from them in terms of graphics... consult the -&gt; http://www.lgdb.org and -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_gaming</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For running all your MS Win applications you may use:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WINE</strong></p>
<p><strong>====</strong></p>
<p>Wine ( http://www.winehq.org ) lets you run Windows software on other operating systems.</p>
<p>With Wine, you can install and run these applications just like you would in Windows. Wine is still under active development so not every program works yet. But consult the Database of Wine if your application is supported -&gt; http://appdb.winehq.org/</p>
<p><em>Remember: always keep your Wine binaries latest version, so the chance of running the app of your choice to be greater.* Note : winetricks could be useful to configure wine *</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>WINE: PLAY ON LINUX</strong></em></p>
<p><em>===================</em></p>
<p>Play on Linux (http://www.playonlinux.com/en) its Basically Based on wine. It offers you some &#039;scripts&#039; to let you install lots of games and other windows software more easily in wine. what these scripts do:</p>
<ul><li>Make a sort of &#039;bottle&#039; to install the best wine version for the specific game or program you want to install, so all your wine installations will be separated from each other. (This is due because of the fact that some games or drivers may affect other games or programs in the same wine Installation.)</li>
<li>Installs needed drivers, components or fonts.</li>
<li>Installs your game or program by downloading it from the internet, using a CD or using an .exe file</li>
<li>Makes shortcuts</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Note: <em>if you remove a &#039;bottle&#039; in Play on Linux, The whole wine installation in that bottle, with its game and drivers will be removed</em>. <em>Other wine installations will be unaffected.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To fully understand how Play on Linux works and how you can install windows software with it, is written in the documentation --&gt; http://www.playonlinux.com/en/page-2-Documentation.html</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>VIRTUALBOX</strong></p>
<p><strong>=========</strong></p>
<p>VirtualBox ( https://www.virtualbox.org/ ) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. It is an extremely feature rich and high performance product.</p>
<p>Actually you may look at it as your virtual brand new PC box, that needs an OS to be installed. This means you need a Windows/Linux/Mac installation media, that you will use to install your OS on the virtual PC. This virtual PC will actually run in your Linux... Thus the bad side of this is that it requires more resources i.e. a powerful  real PC.</p>
<p>Another bad side - do not expect games to work ok.. the 3D support is there but still not that mature...</p>
<p>More detailed instructions on how to <strong><em>install Windows in a Linux VirtualBox</em></strong> environment you can find here -&gt; http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html* Note : you could run a native partition as a virtual machine (your windows partition if you use a dual-boot)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>For Ubuntu family (as in Debian and the main RPM distributions)</em></strong> follow these steps for installing VirtualBox (VB):</p>
<ol><li>Add the VB repo as described here -&gt; https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads (look in the section &quot;<em>Debian-based Linux distributions</em>&quot; or the &quot;<em>RPM-based Linux distributions&quot; section depending on your distribution)</em></li>
<li>In your package manager select the latest VB package (not the OSE one) and install it.</li>
<li>Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and Download the <em>Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack </em>that should be the same version number as your VB that you have installed from your package manager</li>
<li>Click on the downloaded Extension pack file (alternatively you can  install it from the Options menu of VB itself) so it can be  autoinstalled in your VB application.</li>
<li>Next follow the steps described in the tutorial link above (http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html)</li>

<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES AND TIPS (by users):</strong></p>
<p><strong>=========================</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I have tried many methods of running Windows games while still having Linux installed on my computer. Running VM software such as Virtual-box or others do not support hardware acceleration. All the first person shooters and action Windows games require this. Thus running Windows in a VM is not a viable alternative for running games. Another alternative is installing Wine and/or it&#039;s variations. PlayonLinux and Crossover are pre-configured versions of Wine. Many games will work fine in them. But <em><strong>I would recommend turning off Compiz or any of the 3D add in applications in Gnome or KDE</strong></em>. Running 3D in Linux will give you pretty effects, but will compete with Wine for resources. Turn them off in Linux first. <strong><em>If you must play Windows games, it is best to install Windows on your computer also.</em></strong> If you only have 1 drive installed, it is best to create some free space on it and then install Linux in the free space. Your favorite distribution should then install a boot-loader such as Grub. This will ask you which operating system you wish to run on boot up. I have Linux installed on a completely different drive than Windows. When I installed Linux, I disconnected my Windows drive and installed it on a new drive. I do not use a boot loader either. I tell my BIOS which drive to start first. I believe this is the simplest and safest way to run Linux. I actually have 3 drives installed. I use one for Windows, one for Mint, and one for experimenting.</li>
