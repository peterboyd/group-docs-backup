It spreads on Facebook by sending messages and making wall posts on behalf of the infected user. These messages contain a link, which will prompt you to download and install a newer version of Adobe Flash player. However, this download actually contains a malicious file that, once opened, uses your Facebook account to continue posting this malicious link on your behalf, thus spreading the virus. Right now, only Windows users can be infected by Koobface. Once you are infected:</p>\n<ul><li>You may receive pop ups asking you to install &quot;security software&quot; which is fraudulent.</li>\n<li>Websites you visit through Google may be replaced with fraudulent websites, making money for the bad guys.</li>\n<li>If you develop websites, passwords to your website may be stolen by the virus.</li>\n</ul><p>If you think your computer has been infected with Koobface, click\u00a0here.
