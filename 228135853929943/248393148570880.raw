Of course there are other means you can do this, but this one is easiest for new Linux users...<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CASE:</strong> Let&#039;s say you have a Laptop and a wifi card or an usb modem that is not supported out of the box by your Ubuntu... And you do not have any other means to connect to the Internet with your Linux box (no LAN cable, no WIFI hotspot and other WIFI adapter ect). In this case we are using the ZTE AC682 modem as an example.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>PREREQUISITES: </strong>You need at least one PC/Laptop etc that is connected to the Internet... For example borrow one from your friend... To ease the whole process... you may copy/paste all the output from the commands below to a text file, transfer that text file using an USB stick to the PC  that has a Net connection.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>TERMS:</strong> <em>PC 1</em> = your no Net connection Linux box, <em>PC 2 </em>= your net connected other computer. You will work in terminal for all these commands</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>PC 1(in terminal): jockey-text -l</li>\n<li>The output will say something like: <em>kmod:wl - Broadcom STA wireless driver (Proprietary, Disable, Not in use) (auto-install)</em>. Search in your package manager for the strings listed in the output, in order to find the necessary package. In this case we find that the needed driver is: <em>bcmwl-kernel-source</em></li>\n<li>PC 1(in terminal): <em>sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source</em> .
