Wine is still under active development so not every program works yet.

Actually it is a helper script to download and install various redistributable  runtime libraries needed to run some programs in Wine. These may include  replacements for components of Wine using closed source libraries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>WINE: PLAY ON LINUX</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>================</em></p>\n<p>Play on Linux (http://www.playonlinux.com/en) is actually based on Wine. It offers you some &#039;scripts&#039; to let you install lots of games and other windows software more easily in Wine. What these scripts do:</p>\n<ul><li>Make a sort of &#039;bottle&#039; to install the best wine version for the specific game or program you want to install, so all your Wine installations will be separated from each other. (This is due of the fact that some games or drivers may affect other games or programs in the same Wine installation.)</li>\n<li>Installs the needed drivers, components or fonts.</li>\n<li>Installs your game or program by downloading it from the Internet, using a CD or using an .exe file</li>\n<li>Makes shortcuts</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: <em>if you remove a &#039;bottle&#039; in Play on Linux, the whole wine installation in that bottle, with its game and drivers will be removed</em>. <em>Other wine installations will be unaffected.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To fully understand how Play on Linux works and how you can install windows software with it, read its the documentation --&gt; http://www.playonlinux.com/en/page-2-Documentation.html</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>VIRTUALBOX</strong></p>\n<p><strong>=========</strong></p>\n<p>VirtualBox ( https://www.virtualbox.org/ ) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. It is an extremely feature rich and high performance product.</p>\n<p>Actually you may look at it as your virtual brand new PC box, that needs an OS to be installed. This means you need a Windows/Linux/Mac installation media, that you will use to install your OS on the virtual PC. This virtual PC will actually run in your Linux... Thus the bad side of this is that it requires more resources i.e. a powerful\u00a0 real PC.</p>\n<p>Another bad side - do not expect games to work ok.. the 3D support is there but still not that mature...</p>\n<p>More detailed instructions on how to <strong><em>install Windows in a Linux VirtualBox</em></strong> environment you can find here -&gt; http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html* Note : you could run a native partition as a virtual machine (your windows partition if you use a dual-boot)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>For Ubuntu family (as in Debian and the main RPM distributions)</em></strong> follow these steps for installing VirtualBox (VB):</p>\n<ol><li>Add the VB repo as described here -&gt; https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads (look in the section &quot;<em>Debian-based Linux distributions</em>&quot; or the &quot;<em>RPM-based Linux distributions&quot; section depending on your distribution)</em></li>\n<li>In your package manager select the latest VB package (not the OSE one) and install it.</li>\n<li>Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and Download the <em>Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack </em>that should be the same version number as your VB that you have installed from your package manager</li>\n<li>Click on the downloaded Extension pack file (alternatively you can  install it from the Options menu of VB itself) so it can be  autoinstalled in your VB application.</li>\n<li>Next follow the steps described in the tutorial link above (http://www.knowliz.com/2009/01/install-windows-7-with-ubuntu-using.html)</li>\n</ol><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES AND TIPS (by users):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>=========================</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>I have tried many methods of running Windows games while still having Linux installed on my computer. Running VM software such as Virtual-box or others do not support hardware acceleration. All the first person shooters and action Windows games require this. Thus running Windows in a VM is not a viable alternative for running games. Another alternative is installing Wine and/or it&#039;s variations. PlayonLinux and Crossover are pre-configured versions of Wine. Many games will work fine in them. But <em><strong>I would recommend turning off Compiz or any of the 3D add in applications in Gnome or KDE</strong></em>. Running 3D in Linux will give you pretty effects, but will compete with Wine for resources. Turn them off in Linux first. <strong><em>If you must play Windows games, it is best to install Windows on your computer also.</em></strong> If you only have 1 drive installed, it is best to create some free space on it and then install Linux in the free space. Your favorite distribution should then install a boot-loader such as Grub. This will ask you which operating system you wish to run on boot up. I have Linux installed on a completely different drive than Windows. When I installed Linux, I disconnected my Windows drive and installed it on a new drive. I do not use a boot loader either. I tell my BIOS which drive to start first. I believe this is the simplest and safest way to run Linux. I actually have 3 drives installed. I use one for Windows, one for Mint, and one for experimenting.</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL TOOLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>=============</strong></p>\n<ul><li>DJL (for linux games)</li>\n<li>Gelide (mostly emulators)</li>\n<li>QMC2 (old games and emulators)</li>\n<li>Lutris (Game database with configuration control, handle many types of games)</li>\n<li>DBGL (Dos games)</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WINE HELPERS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>==========</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Q4Wine</li>\n<li>WineXS</li>\n<li>Vineyard</li>\n<li>Wibom</li>\n<li>Gametree linux (known as Cedega before)</li>\n<li>Crossover Games or Professional (main Wine contributor, if you want games on linux).</li>\n<li>BordeauWine Skin</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GAME BUYING PLATFORMS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>==================</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Steam (Windows/Mac)</li>\n<li>Desura (Windows/Linux)</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>APPLICATIONS STREAMING:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>==================</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Stream my game (need a gaming windows pc and a your linux pc)</li>\n<li>Onlive Single player game transmitter </li>\n<li>Untested/Unchecked applications streaming: Game string, Playcast, AppProxy, GaikaiGame, adrenalin, Happy cloud</li>\n</ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>OTHER VIRTUALIZATION TOOLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>=====================</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Vmware\u00a0</li>\n<li>Best open source game effort: Humbleindiebundle.com (windows/linux/mac)</li>\n</ul><p>www.penguspy.com good linux games website</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>TO EDIT: Add more</p>", "subject": "Linux, Gaming and MS Windows Applications", "id": "228584533885075", "icon": "https://s-static.ak.facebook.com/rsrc.php/v1/yi/r/-64q65AWgXb.png"}
