<p><strong>Your Question</strong></p>
<p>Before posting, it is always a good idea to know exactly what your  questions is.  That sounds strange, I know, but too often we see short,  one line questions which need lots of further questioning until we can  see the problem.  In fact, the best thing to do is to run a Search first - chances are, your question has been asked and answered over and over again already.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<p>Bad Question:  <em>Help me, &lt;program&gt; just stopped working, what do I do????</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>That does not give us any of the information needed to help you.  We  need to know: your distribution (really this should be set in your User  Profile so you only need to type it in once), the version of the program  (if it&#039;s, for example, GAIM, the answer may simply be to upgrade to the  latest version), how you were trying to run it, what happens if you run  it from the console, what error messages you get, what searches you  have run already (this is important, there&#039;s nothing worse than spending  ages on a search for someone only to be told &quot;I tried that&quot;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even worse, is to say that you are too busy to search.  Why should your  time be more valuable than anybody else&#039;s?  We are not your personal  technical support team, nor are we your personal research assistant, the  spirit of Linux (one of the many spirits :)) is of helping yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So a good question would be:</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>I have been trying to get GAIM running and it will not connect to  MSN. I am running version x.xx in Fedora Core 2.  When I open it, there  is no problem, but when I try to connect to MSN, it returns &quot;error  message&quot;.  All other applications seem to connect with no problems.</em></p>
<p><em> I have tried a search on Google, but I really don&#039;t know what I need to  search for.  Can anyone help me to solve this?  Please bear in mind that  I am new to this and so would appreciate being told in plain English  what I need to do or where I need to start</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What was written above applies to all questions - we need information.   Tell us your hardware, what happened before you tried it, what changes  have you made.  Tell us everything - you save a lot of frustration down  the line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Be Polite</strong></p>
<p>It may be that after 10 posts, you still haven&#039;t found an answer.  Instead of posting this, it would be a good idea to read back over the  posts and see if you can work out why it is that no one can answer you.   Does your question need restating?  Is there a piece of information  which, at the start, seemed not to need stating but now does?  Have you  tried any additional troubleshooting since posting?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What If No One Answers You?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, if after sitting for an hour hitting refresh on your browser no  one answers, do not despair.  LQ&#039;s membership is drawn up from a wide  variety of people - from all around the world.  2pm your time is the  middle of the night for someone else - and that person may have the  answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My (and everyone&#039;s) advice is to wait for 24 hours - give us all a chance to see your post.  If no one answers after <em>at least</em> 24 hours, reply to your own post giving us some more information:  of  course, you didn&#039;t sit there waiting, did you? No, you searched and  tried some things - tell us what you tried, it may mean that a member  seeing your post will know what you need to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What To Do When Your Question is Answered</strong></p>
<p>Tell us.  Tell us what worked for you.  Someone coming along after you  with an identical problem needs to know if the fixes work.  And, just as  importantly, the people who have spent their free time helping you  would like to know that you have now solved the problem.  Please don&#039;t  just vanish or walk away without saying Thanks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And Remember</strong> - every member is doing this on their own time and for no remuneration.   No one is guaranteed an answer and no one can always expect one.</p>
