I was only *active* admin. I started posting relevant articles, added numerous documents and started answering to newbies, directing them. </div><div>By investing my PERSONAL time, I managed to expand the group to reach 13.000 members (43 times) and create 90-95% of documents in this group, most from my own personal notes.</div><div>Bert, John and Waybe we asked by me to join helping this group as admins.</div><div>So essentially, my purpose was to make this group happen and keep it exist as vibrant community \u3000 Generally, people helping on CentOS forums, mailing-lists and IRC chat rooms think of Facebook as redundant and only few joined this group.</div><div>If you think that other members here can do the better job, then you are gravelly mistaken, since one of my jobs is to delete those horrible answers that newbies leave to newbies, so others do not see them, then comments of people that are answering to original post even when next few comments establish that OP has not even asked the right question because they do not bother to read all the comments, etc. Essentially, my job is to read every post and every comment and make sure that each and every one of them is correct, and the delete the rest. Not just few times I had to stop 50-comment long ramblings and to delete 2/3sd and then give the answers my self. </div><div>The reason is that 90% of people here are newbies, and my reason for keeping this group is to allow newbies that &quot;only&quot; use Facebook, and do not know or do not care to register on CentOS Forums, mailing-lists and IRC rooms get first bits of knowledge and learn about CentOS and where to find more info. </div><div>Since I spend my PERSONAL time on helping others FIND their answers, meaning POINTING them in the right direction, not spoon-feeding them, I expect members the respect of MY time, and willingness to help. So the rules are:</div><div>1. READ the Pinned post and try to find answers by your self FIRST. It is even written on the Group photo!</div><div>2. Do not force me to stare at pictures and then retype what I manage to read into the search engines to find what you need but unable to SEARCH for it (99% of my answers come from Google search with proper phrase)</div><div>3. Provide sane question so I do not have to spend hours trying to force answers from you (other venues like the Forums DEMAND that you provide output from info-gathering shell script).</div><div>4. Do not post SPAM.<br />5. Write properly, not in slang.<br /></div>", "revision": "10152930685262728", "id": "10152930685277728", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y7/r/8zhNI-VGpiI.png"}
